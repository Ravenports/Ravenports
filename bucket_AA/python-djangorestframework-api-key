## Introduction

**Django REST Framework API Key is a library for allowing server-side
clients to safely use your API.** These clients are typically third-party
backends and services (i.e. _machines_) which do not have a user account
but still need to interact with your API in a secure way.

### Features

- ✌️ **Simple to use**: create, view and revoke API keys via the admin
site, or use built-in helpers to create API keys programmatically.
- 🔒 **As secure as possible**: API keys are treated with the same level
of care as user passwords. They are only visible at creation and hashed
before storing in the database.
- 🎨 **Customizable**: satisfy specific business requirements by building
your own customized API key models, permission classes and admin panels.

### Should I use API keys?

There are important security aspects you need to consider before switching
to an API key access control scheme. We've listed some of these in
[Security caveats], including serving your API over HTTPS.

Besides, see [Why and when to use API keys] for hints on whether API keys
can fit your use case.

API keys are ideal in the following situations:

- Blocking anonymous traffic.
- Implementing API key-based [throttling]. (Note that Django REST Framework
already has may built-in utilities for this use case.)
- Identifying usage patterns by logging request information along with the
API key.

They can also present enough security for authorizing internal services,
such as your API server and an internal frontend application.

> Please note that this package is NOT meant for authentication. You should
NOT use this package to identify individual users, either directly or
indirectly.
>
> If you need server-to-server authentication, you may want to consider
OAuth instead. Libraries such as [django-oauth-toolkit] can help.

## Quickstart

Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install "djangorestframework-api-key==3.*"
```

_**Note**: It is highly recommended to **pin your dependency** to the
latest major version (as depicted above), as breaking changes may and will
happen between major releases._

Add the app to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  # ...
  "rest_framework",
  "rest_framework_api_key",
]
```

Run the included migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

To learn how to configure permissions and manage API keys, head to the
[Documentation].
