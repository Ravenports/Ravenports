wk: Lightweight Well-Known Geometry Parsing

Provides a minimal R and C++ API for parsing well-known binary and
well-known text representation of geometries to and from R-native formats.
Well-known binary is compact and fast to parse; well-known text is
human-readable and is useful for writing tests. These formats are only
useful in R if the information they contain can be accessed in R, for which
high-performance functions are provided here.
