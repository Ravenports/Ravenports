[FILE:523:descriptions/desc.single]
The Lumina Desktop Environment is a lightweight system interface that is
designed for use on any Unix-like operating system. It takes a plugin-
based approach, allowing the entire interface to be assembled or arranged
by each individual user as desired, with a system-wide default layout
which can be customized by the system administrator. This allows every
system (or user session) to be designed to maximize the individual user's
productivity.

This meta-package installs all the packages related to the Lumina desktop.
