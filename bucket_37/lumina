The Lumina Desktop Environment is a lightweight system interface that is
designed for use on any Unix-like operating system. It takes a plugin-
based approach, allowing the entire interface to be assembled or arranged
by each individual user as desired, with a system-wide default layout
which can be customized by the system administrator. This allows every
system (or user session) to be designed to maximize the individual user's
productivity.

This meta-package installs all the packages related to the Lumina desktop.

been added to the system, but if you with to start Lumina manually, you will
need to do one of the following:
  1) Run "start-lumina-desktop" from the command line after logging in.
  2) Put the line "exec start-lumina-desktop" at the end of your user's
     "~/.xinitrc" file before running startx with any special X11 flags

Also note that the system-wide default settings for Lumina are contained in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/luminaDesktop.conf[.dist]. While it is possible to customize
the desktop to the user's liking after logging in, you may want to adjust
the default settings as necessary if there are multiple user accounts on
this system.
