yamlloader
==========

This module provides loaders and dumpers for PyYAML. Currently, an
OrderedDict loader/dumper is
implemented, allowing to keep items order
when loading resp. dumping a file from/to an OrderedDict (Python 3.8+: Also
regular dicts are supported and are the default items to be loaded to. As
of Python 3.7 preservation of insertion order is a language feature of
regular dicts.)

This project was originally mirrored from
[yamlordereddict]
Many thanks to the original author François Ménabé!
The library contains several improvements including automated testing and
the much faster C-versions of the Loaders/Dumpers.

[API Documentation]

Install
-------
There is a pip and a conda version available

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install yamlloader

or

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install yamlloader -c conda-forge

But does [your special case here] also work?
--------------------------------------------

Tests are run continuously using randomly generated yaml files.
Also, there are no fails to be expected.

Still, if you are concerned that *your* special case may breaks in the
future, please
add your own tests as `test_ext_anyname.py` under `tests/` or let us know
about your needs.
This guarantees that no code will be added that breaks *your* case.

C vs non-C version
------------------

A significant speedup can be reached by replacing the Loader* and Dumper*
classes by CLoader*
and CDumper*. The package hereby relies on the implementations from PyYAML.
If they have not
been compiled, *yamlloader* **automatically** falls back to the non-C
versions.

Therefore using the C-version is safe: if it is not available, the pure
Python version is
automatically used.

Usage examples
==============

Loader usage
------------

.. code-block:: python

    import yaml
    import yamlloader

    with open('myfile.yml') as yaml_file:
        data = yaml.load(yaml_file,
                         Loader=yamlloader.ordereddict.CLoader)
                         # CLoader is faster than Loader

**Note:** For using the safe loader (which takes standard YAML tags and
does
not construct arbitrary Python objects), replace
``yamlloader.ordereddict.CLoader by
yamlloader.ordereddict.CSafeLoader``.

Dumper usage
------------

.. code-block:: python

    import yaml
    import yamlloader
    from collections import OrderedDict

    data = OrderedDict([('key1', 'val1'),
                        ('key2', OrderedDict([('key21', 'val21'),
                                              ('key22', 'val22')]))])

    with open('myfile.yaml', 'w') as yaml_file:
        yaml.dump(data, yaml_file,
                  Dumper=yamlloader.ordereddict.CDumper)
