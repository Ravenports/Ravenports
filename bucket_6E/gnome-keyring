[FILE:455:descriptions/desc.single]
GNOME Keyring is a collection of components in GNOME that store secrets, 
passwords, keys, certificates and make them available to applications. It 
is integrated with the user's login, so that their secret storage can be 
unlocked when the user logins into their session.

The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master 
password, and there is also  session keyring which is never stored to 
disk, but forgotten when the session ends.
