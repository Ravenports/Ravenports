[FILE:765:descriptions/desc.single]
The IO::Like module provides the methods of an IO object based upon on a 
few simple methods provided by the including class: unbuffered_read, 
unbuffered_write, and unbuffered_seek.  These methods provide the 
underlying read, write, and seek support respectively, and only the method 
or methods necessary to the correct operation of the IO aspects of the 
including class need to be provided.  Missing functionality will cause the 
resulting object to appear read-only, write-only, and/or unseekable 
depending on which underlying methods are absent.  Additionally, read and 
write operations which are buffered in IO are buffered with independently 
configurable buffer sizes.  Duplexed objects (those with separate read and 
write streams) are also supported.
