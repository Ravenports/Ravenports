Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced
in English. The goal is for names with the same pronunciation to be encoded
to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor
differences in spelling. Soundex is the most widely known of all phonetic
algorithms and is often used (incorrectly) as a synonym for "phonetic
algorithm". Improvements to Soundex are the basis for many modern phonetic
algorithms. (Wikipedia, 2007)/n/nThis module implements the original
soundex algorithm developed by Robert Russell and Margaret Odell, patented
in 1918 and 1922, as well as a variation called "American Soundex" used for
US census data, and current maintained by the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA).
