## Installation

See the INSTALLATION file in the source distribution for details. In
summary, install PyAudio using `pip` on most platforms.

### Windows

```sh
python -m pip install pyaudio
```

This installs the precompiled PyAudio library with PortAudio v19 19.7.0
included. The library is compiled with support for Windows MME API,
DirectSound, WASAPI, and WDM-KS. It does not include support for ASIO. If
you require support for APIs not included, you will need to compile
PortAudio and PyAudio.

### macOS

Use [Homebrew] to install the prerequisite [portaudio] library, then
install PyAudio using `pip`:

`sh
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
`

### GNU/Linux

Use the package manager to install PyAudio. For example, on Debian-based
systems:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
```

Alternatively, if the latest version of PyAudio is not available, install
it using `pip`. Be sure to first install development libraries for
`portaudio19` and `python3`.

### Building from source

See the INSTALLATION file.

## Documentation & Usage Examples

* Read the [API Documentation], or generate it from the source using
[`sphinx`].

* Usage examples are in the `examples` directory of the source
distribution, or see the [project homepage].
