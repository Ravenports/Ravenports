About
-----

billiard is a fork of the Python 2.7 [multiprocessing]
package. The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated
version of
R Oudkerk's [pyprocessing] package.
This standalone variant draws its fixes/improvements from python-trunk and
provides
additional bug fixes and improvements.

- This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not
only
  the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the original
pyprocessing
  package listed [here].

- Also, it is a fork of the multiprocessing backport package by Christian
Heims.

- It includes the no-execv patch contributed by R. Oudkerk.

- And the Pool improvements previously located in `Celery`_.

- Billiard is used in and is a dependency for `Celery`_ and is maintained
by the
  Celery team.

.. _`Celery`: http://celeryproject.org
