Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using
the
McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes
utilities
to create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool.

This is release 1.4.3, providing a simple extension that allows for
Diff::LCS::Change objects to be treated implicitly as arrays and fixes a
number of formatting issues.

Ruby versions below 2.5 are soft-deprecated, which means that older
versions
are no longer part of the CI test suite. If any changes have been
introduced
that break those versions, bug reports and patches will be accepted, but it
will be up to the reporter to verify any fixes prior to release. The next
major release will completely break compatibility.
