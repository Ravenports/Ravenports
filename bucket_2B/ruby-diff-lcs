Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using
the
McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes
utilities
to create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool.

This is release 1.4, providing a simple extension that allows for
Diff::LCS::Change objects to be treated implicitly as arrays. Ruby versions
below 2.5 are soft-deprecated.

This means that older versions are no longer part of the CI test suite. If
any
changes have been introduced that break those versions, bug reports and
patches
will be accepted, but it will be up to the reporter to verify any fixes
prior
to release. A future release will completely break compatibility.
