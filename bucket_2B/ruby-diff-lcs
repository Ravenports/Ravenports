Diff::LCS computes the difference between two Enumerable sequences using
the
McIlroy-Hunt longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It includes
utilities
to create a simple HTML diff output format and a standard diff-like tool.

This is release 1.4.3, providing a simple extension that allows for
Diff::LCS::Change objects to be treated implicitly as arrays and fixes a
number
of formatting issues.

Ruby versions below 2.5 are soft-deprecated, which means that older
versions are
no longer part of the CI test suite. If any changes have been introduced
that
break those versions, bug reports and patches will be accepted, but it will
be
up to the reporter to verify any fixes prior to release. The next major
release
will completely break compatibility.
