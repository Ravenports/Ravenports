[FILE:473:descriptions/desc.single]
Meson is a cross-platform build system designed to be both as fast and as
user friendly as possible. It supports many languages and compilers,
including GCC, Clang and Visual Studio. Its build definitions are written
in a simple non-turing complete DSL. The main design point of Meson is
that every moment a developer spends writing or debugging build
definitions is a second wasted.  So is every second spent waiting for the
build system to actually start compiling code.
