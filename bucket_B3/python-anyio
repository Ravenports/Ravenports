AnyIO is an asynchronous networking and concurrency library that works on
top of either asyncio_ or
Trio_. It implements Trio-like `structured concurrency`_ (SC) on top of
asyncio and works in harmony
with the native SC of Trio itself.

Applications and libraries written against AnyIO's API will run unmodified
on either asyncio_ or
Trio_. AnyIO can also be adopted into a library or application
incrementally – bit by bit, no full
refactoring necessary. It will blend in with the native libraries of your
chosen backend.

To find out why you might want to use AnyIO's APIs instead of asyncio's,
you can read about it
[here].

Features
--------

AnyIO offers the following functionality:

* Task groups (nurseries_ in trio terminology)
* High-level networking (TCP, UDP and UNIX sockets)

  * `Happy eyeballs`_ algorithm for TCP connections (more robust than that
of asyncio on Python
    3.8)
  * async/await style UDP sockets (unlike asyncio where you still have to
use Transports and
    Protocols)

* A versatile API for byte streams and object streams
* Inter-task synchronization and communication (locks, conditions, events,
semaphores, object
  streams)
* Worker threads
* Subprocesses
* Subinterpreter support for code parallelization (on Python 3.13 and
later)
* Asynchronous file I/O (using worker threads)
* Signal handling
* Asynchronous version of the functools_ module

AnyIO also comes with its own pytest_ plugin which also supports
asynchronous fixtures.
It even works with the popular Hypothesis_ library.
