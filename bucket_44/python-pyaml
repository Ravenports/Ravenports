pretty-yaml (or pyaml)
======================

PyYAML_-based python module to produce a bit more pretty and human-readable
YAML-serialized data.

This module is for serialization only, see `ruamel.yaml`_ module for
literate
YAML parsing (keeping track of comments, spacing, line/column numbers of
values, etc).

(side-note: to dump stuff parsed by ruamel.yaml with this module, use only
``YAML(typ='safe')`` there)

It's a small module, and for projects that only need part of its
functionality,
I'd recommend copy-pasting that in, instead of adding janky dependency.

Warning
-------

Prime goal of this module is to produce human-readable output that can be
easily diff'ed, manipulated and re-used, but maybe with occasional issues.

So please do not rely on the thing to produce output that can always be
deserialized exactly to what was exported, at least - use PyYAML directly
for that (but maybe with options from the next section).

What this module does and why
-----------------------------

YAML is generally nice and easy format to read *if* it was written by
humans.

PyYAML can a do fairly decent job of making stuff readable, and the best
combination of parameters for such output that I've seen so far is probably
this one::

  >>> m = [123, 45.67, {1: None, 2: False}, 'some text']
  >>> data = dict(a='asldnsa\nasldpáknsa\n', b='whatever text', ma=m,
mb=m)
  >>> yaml.safe_dump(data, sys.stdout, allow_unicode=True,
default_flow_style=False)
  a: 'asldnsa

    asldpáknsa

    '
  b: whatever text
  ma: &id001
  - 123
  - 45.67
  - 1: null
    2: false
  - some text
  mb: *id001

pyaml (this module) tries to improve on that a bit, with the following
tweaks:

* Most human-friendly representation options in PyYAML (that I know of)
  are used as defaults.

* Dump "null" values as empty values, if possible, which have the same
meaning
  but reduce visual clutter and are easier to edit.

* Dicts, sets, OrderedDicts, defaultdicts, namedtuples, enums, dataclasses,
etc
  are represented as their safe YAML-compatible base (like int, list or
mapping),
  with mappings key-sorted by default for more diff-friendly output.

* Use shorter and simplier yes/no for booleans.

* List items get indented, as they should be.

* Attempt is made to pick more readable string representation styles,
depending
  on the value, e.g.::

    >>> yaml.safe_dump(cert, sys.stdout)
    cert: '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
