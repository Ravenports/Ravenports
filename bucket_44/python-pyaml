pretty-yaml (or pyaml)
======================

PyYAML-based python module to produce pretty and readable YAML-serialized
data.

This module is for serialization only, see `ruamel.yaml`_ module for
literate
YAML parsing (keeping track of comments, spacing, line/column numbers of
values, etc).

[note: to dump stuff parsed by ruamel.yaml with this module, use only
``YAML(typ='safe')`` there]

.. contents::
  :backlinks: none

Warning
-------

Prime goal of this module is to produce human-readable output that can be
easily
manipulated and re-used, but maybe with some occasional caveats.

One good example of such "caveat" is that e.g. ``{'foo': '123'} will
serialize
to foo: 123``, which for PyYAML would be a bug, as 123 will then be read
back
as an integer from that, but here it's a feature.

So please do not rely on the thing to produce output that can always be
deserialized exactly to what was exported, at least - use PyYAML (e.g. with
options from the next section) for that.

What this module does and why
-----------------------------

YAML is generally nice and easy format to read *if* it was written by
humans.

PyYAML can a do fairly decent job of making stuff readable, and the best
combination of parameters for such output that I've seen so far is probably
this one::

  >>> m = [123, 45.67, {1: None, 2: False}, u'some text']
  >>> data = dict(a=u'asldnsa\nasldpáknsa\n', b=u'whatever text', ma=m,
mb=m)
  >>> yaml.safe_dump(data, sys.stdout, allow_unicode=True,
default_flow_style=False)
  a: 'asldnsa

    asldpáknsa

    '
  b: whatever text
  ma: &id001
  - 123
  - 45.67
  - 1: null
    2: false
  - some text
  mb: *id001

pyaml tries to improve on that a bit, with the following tweaks:

* Most human-friendly representation options in PyYAML (that I know of) get
  picked as defaults.

* Does not dump "null" values, if possible, replacing these with just empty
  strings, which have the same meaning but reduce visual clutter and are
easier
  to edit.

* Dicts, sets, OrderedDicts, defaultdicts, namedtuples, etc are
representable
  and get sorted on output (OrderedDicts and namedtuples keep their
ordering),
  so that output would be as diff-friendly as possible, and not arbitrarily
  depend on python internals.

  It appears that at least recent PyYAML versions also do such sorting for
  python dicts.

* List items get indented, as they should be.

* bytestrings that can't be auto-converted to unicode raise error, as yaml
has
  no "binary bytes" (i.e. unix strings) type.

* Attempt is made to pick more readable string representation styles,
depending
  on the value, e.g.::

    >>> yaml.safe_dump(cert, sys.stdout)
    cert: '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
