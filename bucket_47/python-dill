dill: serialize all of Python

About Dill
==========

dill extends Python's pickle module for serializing and de-serializing
Python objects to the majority of the built-in Python types. Serialization
is the process of converting an object to a byte stream, and the inverse
of which is converting a byte stream back to a Python object hierarchy.

dill provides the user the same interface as the pickle module, and
also includes some additional features. In addition to pickling Python
objects, dill provides the ability to save the state of an interpreter
session in a single command.  Hence, it would be feasible to save an
interpreter session, close the interpreter, ship the pickled file to
another computer, open a new interpreter, unpickle the session and
thus continue from the 'saved' state of the original interpreter
session.

dill can be used to store Python objects to a file, but the primary
usage is to send Python objects across the network as a byte stream.
dill is quite flexible, and allows arbitrary user defined classes
and functions to be serialized.  Thus dill is not intended to be
secure against erroneously or maliciously constructed data. It is
left to the user to decide whether the data they unpickle is from
a trustworthy source.

dill is part of pathos, a Python framework for heterogeneous computing.
dill is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,
or suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of issues is located at
https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues, with a legacy list maintained
at
https://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos/query.

Major Features
==============

dill can pickle the following standard types:

    - none, type, bool, int, float, complex, bytes, str,
    - tuple, list, dict, file, buffer, builtin,
    - Python classes, namedtuples, dataclasses, metaclasses,
    - instances of classes,
    - set, frozenset, array, functions, exceptions

dill can also pickle more 'exotic' standard types:

    - functions with yields, nested functions, lambdas,
    - cell, method, unboundmethod, module, code, methodwrapper,
    - methoddescriptor, getsetdescriptor, memberdescriptor,
wrapperdescriptor,
    - dictproxy, slice, notimplemented, ellipsis, quit

dill cannot yet pickle these standard types:

    - frame, generator, traceback

dill also provides the capability to:

    - save and load Python interpreter sessions
    - save and extract the source code from functions and classes
    - interactively diagnose pickling errors
