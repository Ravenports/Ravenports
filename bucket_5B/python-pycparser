Introduction
============

What is pycparser?
------------------

**pycparser** is a parser for the C language, written in pure Python. It is
a
module designed to be easily integrated into applications that need to
parse
C source code.

What is it good for?
--------------------

Anything that needs C code to be parsed. The following are some uses for
**pycparser**, taken from real user reports:

* C code obfuscator
* Front-end for various specialized C compilers
* Static code checker
* Automatic unit-test discovery
* Adding specialized extensions to the C language

One of the most popular uses of **pycparser** is in the [cffi
] library, which uses it to parse the
declarations of C functions and types in order to auto-generate FFIs.

**pycparser** is unique in the sense that it's written in pure Python - a
very
high level language that's easy to experiment with and tweak. To people
familiar
with Lex and Yacc, **pycparser**'s code will be simple to understand. It
also
has no external dependencies (except for a Python interpreter), making it
very
simple to install and deploy.

Which version of C does pycparser support?
------------------------------------------

**pycparser** aims to support the full C99 language (according to the
standard
ISO/IEC 9899). Some features from C11 are also supported, and patches to
support
more are welcome.

**pycparser** supports very few GCC extensions, but it's fairly easy to set
things up so that it parses code with a lot of GCC-isms successfully. See
the
[FAQ] for more details.

What grammar does pycparser follow?
-----------------------------------

**pycparser** very closely follows the C grammar provided in Annex A of the
C99
standard (ISO/IEC 9899).

How is pycparser licensed?
--------------------------

[BSD license].
