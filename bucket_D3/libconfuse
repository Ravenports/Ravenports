[FILE:719:descriptions/desc.single]
libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the terms
of the ISC, and written in C. It supports sections and (lists of) values
(strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), as well as some
other features (such as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable
expansion, functions and nested include statements). It makes it very easy
to add configuration file capability to a program using a simple API.

The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library
with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick
to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg before, but was
changed to not confuse with other similar libraries.
