| NetBox Version | Plugin Version |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|
|      3.7       |     1.5.0      |
|      3.6       |     1.4.0      |

|      3.2       |     1.0.1      |

## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins].

You can install with pip:

```bash
pip install netbox-acls
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt`
(netbox-docker):

```bash
netbox-acls
```

## Configuration

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file :

```python
PLUGINS = [
    "netbox_acls"
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_acls": {
        "top_level_menu": True # If set to True the plugin will add a top
level menu item for the plugin. If set to False the plugin will add a menu
item under the Plugins menu item.  Default is set to True.
    },
}
```

## Developing

### VSCode + Docker + Dev Containers

To develop this plugin further one can use the included .devcontainer
configuration. This configuration creates a docker container which includes
a fully working netbox installation. Currently it should work when using
WSL 2. For this to work make sure you have Docker Desktop installed and the
WSL 2 integrations activated.

1. In the WSL terminal, enter `code` to run Visual studio code.
2. Install the devcontainer extension "ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+P and use the "Dev Container: Clone Repository in
Container Volume" function to clone this repository. This will take a while
