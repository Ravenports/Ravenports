# Ansible

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles
configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,
ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration.
Ansible makes complex
changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More
information on the Ansible [website].

## Design Principles

* Have an extremely simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.
* Manage machines quickly and in parallel.
* Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
  leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
* Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
  friendly.
* Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
* Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
  software.
* Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
* Be usable as non-root.
* Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.

## Use Ansible

You can install a released version of Ansible with `pip` or a package
manager. See our
[installation guide] for details on installing Ansible
on a variety of platforms.

Power users and developers can run the `devel` branch, which has the latest
features and fixes, directly. Although it is reasonably stable, you are
more likely to encounter
breaking changes when running the `devel` branch. We recommend getting
involved
in the Ansible community if you want to run the `devel` branch.

## Get Involved

* Read [Community Information] for all
  kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project,
  including mailing list information and how to submit bug reports and
  code to Ansible.
* Join a [Working Group],
  an organized community devoted to a specific technology domain or
platform.
* Submit a proposed code update through a pull request to the `devel`
branch.
* Talk to us before making larger changes
  to avoid duplicate efforts. This not only helps everyone
  know what is going on, but it also helps save time and effort if we
decide
  some changes are needed.
* For a list of email lists, IRC channels and Working Groups, see the
  [Communication page]

## Coding Guidelines

We document our Coding Guidelines in the [Developer Guide]. We particularly
suggest you review:

* [Contributing your module to Ansible]
* [Conventions, tips, and pitfalls]

## Branch Info

* The `devel` branch corresponds to the release actively under development.
* The `stable-2.X` branches correspond to stable releases.
* Create a branch based on `devel` and set up a [dev environment] if you
want to open a PR.
* See the [Ansible release and maintenance] page for information about
active branches.

## Roadmap

Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published
for a major or minor version (ex: 2.7, 2.8).
The [Ansible Roadmap page] details what is planned and how to influence the
roadmap.

## Authors

Ansible was created by [Michael DeHaan]
and has contributions from over 5000 users (and growing). Thanks everyone!
