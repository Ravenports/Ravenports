Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that is typically used in
IDEs/editors plugins. Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto
functionality. Other features include refactoring, code search and finding
references.

Jedi has a simple API to work with. There is a reference implementation as
a
`VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_. Autocompletion in
your
REPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively and for the CPython REPL
you
can install it. Jedi is well tested and bugs should be rare.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)
- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via [Python Extension])
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though. 
[[see
 ]]
- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)
- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)
- Gedit (gedi_)
- wdb_ - Web Debugger
- `Eric IDE`_
- `IPython 6.0.0+
<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_
- [xonsh shell] has [jedi extension]

and many more!

There are a few language servers that use Jedi:

- `jedi-language-server
<https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server>`_
- `python-language-server
<https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server>`_ (currently
unmaintained)
- `python-lsp-server <https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server>`_
(fork from python-language-server)
- `anakin-language-server
<https://github.com/muffinmad/anakin-language-server>`_
