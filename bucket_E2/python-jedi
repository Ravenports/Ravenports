Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in
IDEs/editors. Its
historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as well.
Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper
level
than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It's possible to search
for
related names and to list all names in a Python file and infer them. Jedi
understands docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL as
well.

Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDEs. There's a reference
implementation as a `VIM-Plugin
<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_,
which uses Jedi's autocompletion.  We encourage you to use Jedi in your
IDEs.
It's really easy.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though.
[`proof

<https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?re
v=KDE%2F4.13>`_]
- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)
- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)
- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python>`_)
- Gedit (gedi_)
- wdb_ - Web Debugger
- `Eric IDE`_ (Available as a plugin)
- `IPython 6.0.0+
<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html>`_

and many more!
