Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in
IDEs/editors. Its
historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as well.
Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper
level
than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It's possible to search
for
related names and to list all names in a Python file and infer them. Jedi
understands docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL as
well.

Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDE's. There's a reference
implementation as a `VIM-Plugin
<https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_,
which uses Jedi's autocompletion.  We encourage you to use Jedi in your
IDEs.
It's really easy.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_, deoplete-jedi_, completor.vim_)
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, company-mode_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though.
[`proof

v=KDE%2F4.13>`_]
- Atom_ (autocomplete-python-jedi_)
- SourceLair_
- `GNOME Builder`_ (with support for GObject Introspection)
- `Visual Studio Code`_ (via `Python Extension
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python>`_
)
- Gedit (gedi_)
- wdb_ - Web Debugger
- `Eric IDE`_ (Available as a plugin)
- `Ipython 6.0.0+

and many more!

There is also support for goto and renaming.

Get the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_
(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).

Docs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with
documentation
enhancements and/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic
versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.


Installation
============

    pip install jedi

Note: This just installs the Jedi library, not the editor plugins. For
information about how to make it work with your editor, refer to the
corresponding documentation.

You don't want to use ``pip``? Please refer to the `manual
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.


Feature Support and Caveats
===========================

Jedi really understands your Python code. For a comprehensive list what
Jedi
understands, see: `Features
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_. A list of
caveats can be found on the same page.

You can run Jedi on cPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 but it should also
understand/parse code older than those versions.
