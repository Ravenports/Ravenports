[FILE:593:descriptions/desc.single]
iperf3 is a tool for measuring the achievable TCP, UDP, and SCTP throughput
along a path between two hosts.  It allows the tuning of various parameters
such as socket buffer sizes and maximum attempted throughput.  It reports
(among other things) bandwidth, delay jitter, and datagram loss.  iperf was
originally developed by NLANR/DAST.

iperf3 is a new implementation developed from scratch at the Energy
Sciences Network (ESnet).  Among its goals were a smaller, simpler code
base (compared to its predecessor) and a library version of the
functionality that can be used in other programs.
