R.oo: R Object-Oriented Programming with or without References

Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with or without
references. Large effort has been made on making definition of methods as
simple as possible with a minimum of maintenance for package developers.
The package has been developed since 2001 and is now considered very
stable. This is a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that defines
standard S3 classes without any tricks.
