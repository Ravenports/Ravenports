[FILE:612:descriptions/desc.doomsw]
DooM is a scifi / horror themed first-person shooter game released by ID 
software in 1993. Thanks to its then incredibly powerful engine and the 
fast-paced action, back in the day the game was nothing short of 
revolutionary. It supports different floor and ceiling heights, light 
effects and moving level geometry as well as features like teleporters. 
DooM also introduced the ever popular multiplayer mode known as Deathmatch.

The first of the three original episodes, "Knee-deep in the dead", was 
released as shareware.

This package contains the IWAD (resource container) file for the DooM 
shareware.


[FILE:613:descriptions/desc.hereticsw]
Heretic is a dark fantasy first-person shooter game developed by Raven 
software and released in 1994. It uses a modified version of the Doom 
engine that supports new features like looking up and down as well as an 
inventory. The player can collect several magic artifacts and use them 
later. Those include among others: Health potions, an ancient tome that 
temporarily boosts weapons or the wings of wrath which enable fly-mode.

The first of the three original episodes, "City of the damned", was 
released as shareware.

This package contains the IWAD (resource container) file for the Heretic 
shareware.


[FILE:1080:descriptions/desc.hexendemo]
HeXen is an apocalyptic fantasy first-person shooter by Raven software. 
Published in 1995 it is the sequel to Heretic and uses a heavily improved 
Doom engine with higher resolution and many new features. HeXen lets the 
player choose one of three characters (a warrior, a priest or a mage). 
Each class has unique weapons and attributes such as toughness, power, and 
moving speed. Therefor different tactics are necessary to beat the game 
depending on the class chosen.

Due to introducing hub levels, the game is largely non-linear as 
previously visited levels can be entered again. HeXen includes several 
large-scale puzzles. By completing parts of a puzzle new areas in various 
levels open up. The goal of each hub is to complete the puzzle, defeat the 
boss and get to the next hub. The engine features so-called ACS scripts. 
The scripting makes the world much more dynamic and allows for the 
cross-level puzzles.

A four-level demo version was released for interested people to try out.

This package contains the IWAD (resource container) file for the HeXen 
demo.


[FILE:964:descriptions/desc.strifedemo]
Strife is a scifi themed first-person shooter by Rogue Entertainment that 
was released in 1996. It uses a much enhanced Doom engine. Strife is 
notable for adding some role-playing elements: There is a dialog system, 
player abilities (like accuracy) and several quests can be solved in more 
than one way. A currency (gold coins) can be used to buy items and 
ammunition.

Due to the various missions the player has to accomplish, the story is 
much more important in Strife than in most fps games. As the player joins 
a resistence movement agains the oppressive Order, stealth rather than 
going rampage can be necessary and makes this game stand out from its 
primary genre.

A limited demo version exists. While the game has been considered 
"abandonware" by many and offered for free downloading on the net, it 
actually is not. In 2014 a digital re-release on Steam happened.

This package contains the IWAD (resource container) file for the Strife 
demo.
