python-sql
==========

python-sql is a library to write SQL queries in a pythonic way.

Nutshell
--------

Import::

    >>> from sql import *
    >>> from sql.aggregate import *
    >>> from sql.conditionals import *

Simple selects::

    >>> user = Table('user')
    >>> select = user.select()
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT * FROM "user" AS "a"', ())

    >>> select = user.select(user.name)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."name" FROM "user" AS "a"', ())

    >>> select = user.select(Count(Literal(1)))
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT COUNT(%s) FROM "user" AS "a"', (1,))

    >>> select = user.select(user.name, distinct=True)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT DISTINCT "a"."name" FROM "user" AS "a"', ())

    >>> select = user.select(user.id, user.name)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."id", "a"."name" FROM "user" AS "a"', ())

Select with where condition::

    >>> select.where = user.name == 'foo'
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."id", "a"."name" FROM "user" AS "a" WHERE ("a"."name" =
%s)', ('foo',))

    >>> select.where = (user.name == 'foo') & (user.active == True)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."id", "a"."name" FROM "user" AS "a" WHERE (("a"."name" =
%s) AND ("a"."active" = %s))', ('foo', True))
    >>> select.where = user.name == user.login
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."id", "a"."name" FROM "user" AS "a" WHERE ("a"."name" =
"a"."login")', ())

Select with join::

    >>> join = user.join(Table('user_group'))
    >>> join.condition = join.right.user == user.id
    >>> select = join.select(user.name, join.right.group)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."name", "b"."group" FROM "user" AS "a" INNER JOIN
"user_group" AS "b" ON ("b"."user" = "a"."id")', ())

Select with multiple joins::

    >>> join1 = user.join(Table('user'))
    >>> join2 = join1.join(Table('user'))
    >>> select = join2.select(user.id, join1.right.id, join2.right.id)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT "a"."id", "b"."id", "c"."id" FROM "user" AS "a" INNER JOIN
"user" AS "b" INNER JOIN "user" AS "c"', ())

Select with group_by::

    >>> invoice = Table('invoice')
    >>> select = invoice.select(Sum(invoice.amount), invoice.currency,
    ...         group_by=invoice.currency)
    >>> tuple(select)
    ('SELECT SUM("a"."amount"), "a"."currency" FROM "invoice" AS "a" GROUP
BY "a"."currency"', ())

Select with output name::

    >>> tuple(user.select(user.name.as_('First Name')))
    ('SELECT "a"."name" AS "First Name" FROM "user" AS "a"', ())

Select with order_by::

    >>> tuple(user.select(order_by=user.date))
    ('SELECT * FROM "user" AS "a" ORDER BY "a"."date"', ())
    >>> tuple(user.select(order_by=Asc(user.date)))
    ('SELECT * FROM "user" AS "a" ORDER BY "a"."date" ASC', ())
    >>> tuple(user.select(order_by=(user.date.asc, user.id.desc)))
    ('SELECT * FROM "user" AS "a" ORDER BY "a"."date" ASC, "a"."id" DESC',
())

Select with sub-select::

    >>> user_group = Table('user_group')
    >>> subselect = user_group.select(user_group.user,
    ...     where=user_group.active == True)
