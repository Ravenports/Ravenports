RQ (_Redis Queue_) is a simple Python library for queueing jobs and
processing
them in the background with workers. It is backed by Redis or Valkey and is
designed
to have a low barrier to entry while scaling incredibly well for large
applications.
It can be integrated into your web stack easily, making it suitable for
projects
of any sizeâ€”from simple applications to high-volume enterprise systems.

RQ requires Redis >= 4 or Valkey >= 7.2.

## Support RQ

If you find RQ useful, please consider supporting this project via
[Tidelift].

## Getting started

First, run a Redis server, of course:

```console
$ redis-server
```

To put jobs on queues, you don't have to do anything special, just define
your typically lengthy or blocking function:

```python
import requests

def count_words_at_url(url):
    """Just an example function that's called async."""
    resp = requests.get(url)
    return len(resp.text.split())
```

Then, create an RQ queue:

```python
from redis import Redis
from rq import Queue

queue = Queue(connection=Redis())
```

And enqueue the function call:

```python
from my_module import count_words_at_url
job = queue.enqueue(count_words_at_url, 'http://nvie.com')
```

## Scheduling Jobs

Scheduling jobs is also easy:

```python
# Schedule job to run at 9:15, October 10th
job = queue.enqueue_at(datetime(2019, 10, 10, 9, 15), say_hello)

# Schedule job to run in 10 seconds
job = queue.enqueue_in(timedelta(seconds=10), say_hello)
```

## Repeating Jobs

To execute a `Job` multiple times, use the `Repeat` class:

```python
from rq import Queue, Repeat

# Repeat job 3 times after successful execution, with 30 second intervals
queue.enqueue(my_function, repeat=Repeat(times=3, interval=30))

# Repeat job 3 times with different intervals between runs
queue.enqueue(my_function, repeat=Repeat(times=3, interval=[5, 10, 15]))
```

## Retrying Failed Jobs

Retrying failed jobs is also supported:

```python
from rq import Retry

# Retry up to 3 times, failed job will be requeued immediately
queue.enqueue(say_hello, retry=Retry(max=3))

# Retry up to 3 times, with configurable intervals between retries
queue.enqueue(say_hello, retry=Retry(max=3, interval=[10, 30, 60]))
```
