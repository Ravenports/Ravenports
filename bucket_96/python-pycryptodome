PyCryptodome
============

PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
cryptographic primitives.

It supports Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and newer, and PyPy.

You can install it with::

    pip install pycryptodome

All modules are installed under the Crypto package.

Check the pycryptodomex_ project for the equivalent library that
works under the Cryptodome package.

PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
for instance:

* Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
* Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
* First class support for PyPy
* Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-curves; Ed25519, Ed448)
* Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
  automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher
mode,
  and more)
* SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
* Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
* scrypt and HKDF
* Deterministic (EC)DSA and EdDSA
* Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
* Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
* Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
userspace)
* Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
* Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
* Major clean ups and simplification of the code base

PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block
ciphers)
are implemented as C extensions.
