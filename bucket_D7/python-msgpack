# MessagePack for Python

[Build Status]
[Documentation Status]

## What's this

[MessagePack] is an efficient binary serialization format.
It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON.
But it's faster and smaller.
This package provides CPython bindings for reading and writing MessagePack
data.

## Very important notes for existing users

### PyPI package name

Package name on PyPI was changed from `msgpack-python` to `msgpack` from
0.5.

When upgrading from msgpack-0.4 or earlier, do `pip uninstall
msgpack-python` before
`pip install -U msgpack`.

### Compatibility with the old format

You can use `use_bin_type=False` option to pack `bytes`
object into raw type in the old msgpack spec, instead of bin type in new
msgpack spec.

You can unpack old msgpack format using `raw=True` option.
It unpacks str (raw) type in msgpack into Python bytes.

See note below for detail.

### Major breaking changes in msgpack 1.0

* Python 2

  * The extension module does not support Python 2 anymore.
    The pure Python implementation (`msgpack.fallback`) is used for Python
2.

* Packer

  * `use_bin_type=True` by default.  bytes are encoded in bin type in
msgpack.
    **If you are still using Python 2, you must use unicode for all string
types.**
    You can use `use_bin_type=False` to encode into old msgpack format.
  * `encoding` option is removed.  UTF-8 is used always.

* Unpacker

  * `raw=False` by default.  It assumes str types are valid UTF-8 string
    and decode them to Python str (unicode) object.
  * `encoding` option is removed.  You can use `raw=True` to support old
format.
  * Default value of `max_buffer_size` is changed from 0 to 100 MiB.
  * Default value of `strict_map_key` is changed to True to avoid hashdos.
    You need to pass `strict_map_key=False` if you have data which contain
map keys
    which type is not bytes or str.

## Install

```
$ pip install msgpack
```

### Pure Python implementation

The extension module in msgpack (`msgpack._cmsgpack`) does not support
Python 2 and PyPy.

But msgpack provides a pure Python implementation (`msgpack.fallback`)
for PyPy and Python 2.

### Windows

When you can't use a binary distribution, you need to install Visual Studio
or Windows SDK on Windows.
Without extension, using pure Python implementation on CPython runs slowly.

## How to use

NOTE: In examples below, I use `raw=False` and `use_bin_type=True` for
users
using msgpack < 1.0. These options are default from msgpack 1.0 so you can
omit them.

### One-shot pack & unpack

Use `packb` for packing and `unpackb` for unpacking.
msgpack provides `dumps` and `loads` as an alias for compatibility with
`json` and `pickle`.

`pack` and `dump` packs to a file-like object.
`unpack` and `load` unpacks from a file-like object.
