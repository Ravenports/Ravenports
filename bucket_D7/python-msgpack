# MessagePack for Python

## What's this

[MessagePack] is an efficient binary serialization format.
It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON.
But it's faster and smaller.
This package provides CPython bindings for reading and writing MessagePack
data.

## Very important notes for existing users

### PyPI package name

TL;DR: When upgrading from msgpack-0.4 or earlier, don't do `pip install -U
msgpack-python`.
Do `pip uninstall msgpack-python; pip install msgpack` instead.

Package name on PyPI was changed to msgpack from 0.5.
I upload transitional package (msgpack-python 0.5 which depending on
msgpack)
for smooth transition from msgpack-python to msgpack.

Sadly, this doesn't work for upgrade install.  After `pip install -U
msgpack-python`,
msgpack is removed, and `import msgpack` fail.

### Compatibility with the old format

You can use `use_bin_type=False` option to pack `bytes`
object into raw type in the old msgpack spec, instead of bin type in new
msgpack spec.

You can unpack old msgpack format using `raw=True` option.
It unpacks str (raw) type in msgpack into Python bytes.

See note below for detail.

### Major breaking changes in msgpack 1.0

* Python 2

  * The extension module does not support Python 2 anymore.
    The pure Python implementation (`msgpack.fallback`) is used for Python
2.

* Packer

  * `use_bin_type=True` by default.  bytes are encoded in bin type in
msgpack.
    **If you are still sing Python 2, you must use unicode for all string
types.**
    You can use `use_bin_type=False` to encode into old msgpack format.
  * `encoding` option is removed.  UTF-8 is used always.

* Unpacker

  * `raw=False` by default.  It assumes str types are valid UTF-8 string
    and decode them to Python str (unicode) object.
  * `encoding` option is removed.  You can use `raw=True` to support old
format.
  * Default value of `max_buffer_size` is changed from 0 to 100 MiB.
  * Default value of `strict_map_key` is changed to True to avoid hashdos.
    You need to pass `strict_map_key=False` if you have data which contain
map keys
    which type is not bytes or str.

## Install

   $ pip install msgpack

### Pure Python implementation

The extension module in msgpack (`msgpack._cmsgpack`) does not support
Python 2 and PyPy.

But msgpack provides a pure Python implementation (`msgpack.fallback`)
for PyPy and Python 2.

Since the [pip] uses the pure Python implementation,
Python 2 support will not be dropped in the foreseeable future.

### Windows

When you can't use a binary distribution, you need to install Visual Studio
or Windows SDK on Windows.
Without extension, using pure Python implementation on CPython runs slowly.

## How to use

NOTE: In examples below, I use `raw=False` and `use_bin_type=True` for
users
using msgpack < 1.0. These options are default from msgpack 1.0 so you can
omit them.
