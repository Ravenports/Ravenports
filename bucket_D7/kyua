[FILE:867:descriptions/desc.primary]
Kyua is a testing framework for infrastructure software, originally
designed to equip BSD-based operating systems with a test suite.  This
means that Kyua is lightweight and simple, and that Kyua integrates well
with various build systems and continuous integration frameworks.

Kyua features an expressive test suite definition language, a safe
runtime engine for test suites and a powerful report generation engine.

Kyua is for both developers and users, from the developer applying a
simple fix to a library to the system administrator deploying a new
release on a production machine.

Kyua is able to execute test programs written with a plethora of testing
libraries and languages.  The library of choice is ATF, for which Kyua
was originally designed, but simple, framework-less test programs and
TAP-compliant test programs can also be executed through Kyua.
