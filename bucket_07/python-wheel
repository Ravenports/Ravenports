wheel
=====

This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging
standard, as defined in `PEP 427`_.

It has two different roles:

#. A setuptools_ extension for building wheels that provides the
   bdist_wheel setuptools command
#. A command line tool for working with wheel files

It should be noted that wheel is **not** intended to be used as a library,
and
as such there is no stable, public API.

.. _PEP 427: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/
.. _setuptools: https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/
