Wheel
=====

A built-package format for Python.

A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename
and the .whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a
PEP 376 compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk
format. Many packages will be properly installed with only the "Unpack"
step (simply extracting the file onto sys.path), and the unpacked archive
preserves enough information to "Spread" (copy data and scripts to their
final locations) at any later time.

The wheel project provides a `bdist_wheel` command for setuptools
(requires setuptools >= 0.8.0). Wheel files can be installed with a
newer `pip` from https://github.com/pypa/pip or with wheel's own command
line utility.

The wheel documentation is at https://wheel.readthedocs.io/. The file
format is
documented in PEP 427 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/).

The reference implementation is at https://github.com/pypa/wheel

Why not egg?
------------

Python's egg format predates the packaging related standards we have
today, the most important being PEP 376 "Database of Installed Python
Distributions" which specifies the .dist-info directory (instead of
.egg-info) and PEP 426 "Metadata for Python Software Packages 2.0"
which specifies how to express dependencies (instead of requires.txt
in .egg-info).

Wheel implements these things. It also provides a richer file naming
convention that communicates the Python implementation and ABI as well
as simply the language version used in a particular package.

Unlike .egg, wheel will be a fully-documented standard at the binary
level that is truly easy to install even if you do not want to use the
reference implementation.


Code of Conduct
---------------

Everyone interacting in the wheel project's codebases, issue trackers, chat
rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the `PyPA Code of Conduct`_.

0.31.1
======
- Fixed arch as ``None`` when converting eggs to wheels

0.31.0
======
- Fixed displaying of errors on Python 3
- Fixed single digit versions in wheel files not being properly recognized
- Fixed wrong character encodings being used (instead of UTF-8) to read and
  write ``RECORD`` (this sometimes crashed bdist_wheel too)
- Enabled Zip64 support in wheels by default
- Metadata-Version is now 2.1
- Dropped DESCRIPTION.rst and metadata.json from the list of generated
files
- Dropped support for the non-standard, undocumented ``provides-extra`` and
  ``requires-dist`` keywords in setup.cfg metadata
- Deprecated all wheel signing and signature verification commands
- Removed the (already defunct) ``tool`` extras from setup.py

0.30.0
======
- Added py-limited-api {cp32|cp33|cp34|...} flag to produce
cpNN.abi3.{arch}
  tags on CPython 3.
- Documented the ``license_file`` metadata key
- Improved Python, abi tagging for `wheel convert`. Thanks Ales Erjavec.
- Fixed `>` being prepended to lines starting with "From" in the long
description
- Added support for specifying a build number (as per PEP 427).
  Thanks Ian Cordasco.
- Made the order of files in generated ZIP files deterministic.
  Thanks Matthias Bach.
- Made the order of requirements in metadata deterministic. Thanks Chris
Lamb.
- Fixed `wheel install` clobbering existing files
- Improved the error message when trying to verify an unsigned wheel file
- Removed support for Python 2.6, 3.2 and 3.3.

0.29.0
======
- Fix compression type of files in archive (Issue #155, Pull Request #62,
  thanks Xavier Fernandez)

0.28.0
======
- Fix file modes in archive (Issue #154)

0.27.0
======
- Support forcing a platform tag using `--plat-name` on pure-Python
wheels, as
  well as nonstandard platform tags on non-pure wheels (Pull Request #60,
Issue
  #144, thanks Andrés Díaz)
- Add SOABI tags to platform-specific wheels built for Python 2.X (Pull
Request
