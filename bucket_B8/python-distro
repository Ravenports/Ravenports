`distro` provides information about the
OS distribution it runs on, such as a reliable machine-readable ID, or
version information.

It is the recommended replacement for Python's original
[`platform.linux_distribution`]
function (which will be removed in Python 3.8).
It also provides much more functionality which isn't necessarily Python
bound,
like a command-line interface.

Distro currently supports Linux and BSD based systems but [Windows and OS X
support] is also planned.

For Python 2.6 support, see
https://github.com/nir0s/distro/tree/python2.6-support

## Installation

Installation of the latest released version from PyPI:

`shell
pip install distro
`

Installation of the latest development version:

```shell
pip install https://github.com/nir0s/distro/archive/master.tar.gz
```

## Usage

```bash
$ distro
Name: Antergos Linux
Version: 2015.10 (ISO-Rolling)
Codename: ISO-Rolling

$ distro -j
{
    "codename": "ISO-Rolling",
    "id": "antergos",
    "like": "arch",
    "version": "16.9",
    "version_parts": {
        "build_number": "",
        "major": "16",
        "minor": "9"
    }
}

$ python
>>> import distro
>>> distro.linux_distribution(full_distribution_name=False)
('centos', '7.1.1503', 'Core')
```

## Documentation

On top of the aforementioned API, several more functions are available. For
a complete description of the
API, see the [latest API documentation].

## Background

An alternative implementation became necessary because Python 3.5
deprecated
this function, and Python 3.8 will remove it altogether.
Its predecessor function `platform.dist` was already deprecated since
Python 2.6 and will also be removed in Python 3.8.
Still, there are many cases in which access to that information is needed.
See [Python issue 1322] for more
information.

The `distro` package implements a robust and inclusive way of retrieving
the
information about a distribution based on new standards and old methods,
namely from these data sources (from high to low precedence):

* The os-release file `/etc/os-release`, if present.
* The output of the `lsb_release` command, if available.
* The distro release file (`/etc/*(-|_)(release|version)`), if present.
* The `uname` command for BSD based distrubtions.
