---------------------------------------------

## Installation

Start a redis via docker:

``` bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -it redis/redis-stack:latest
```

To install redis-py, simply:

``` bash
$ pip install redis
```

For faster performance, install redis with hiredis support, this provides a
compiled response parser, and *for most cases* requires zero code changes.
By default, if hiredis >= 1.0 is available, redis-py will attempt to use it
for response parsing.

``` bash
$ pip install "redis[hiredis]"
```

Looking for a high-level library to handle object mapping? See
[redis-om-python]!

## Supported Redis Versions

The most recent version of this library supports redis version [5.0],
[6.0], [6.2], and [7.0].

The table below higlights version compatibility of the most-recent library
versions and redis versions.

| Library version | Supported redis versions |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 3.5.3 | <= 6.2 Family of releases |
| >= 4.1.0 | Version 5.0 to current |

## Usage

### Basic Example

``` python
>>> import redis
>>> r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
>>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
True
>>> r.get('foo')
b'bar'
```

The above code connects to localhost on port 6379, sets a value in Redis,
and retrieves it. All responses are returned as bytes in Python, to receive
decoded strings, set *decode_responses=True*.  For this, and more
connection options, see [these examples].

### Connection Pools

By default, redis-py uses a connection pool to manage connections. Each
instance of a Redis class receives its own connection pool. You can however
define your own [redis.ConnectionPool].

``` python
>>> pool = redis.ConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
>>> r = redis.Redis(connection_pool=pool)
```

Alternatively, you might want to look at [Async connections], or [Cluster
connections], or even [Async Cluster connections].

### Redis Commands

There is built-in support for all of the [out-of-the-box Redis commands].
They are exposed using the raw Redis command names (`HSET`, `HGETALL`,
etc.) except where a word (i.e. del) is reserved by the language. The
complete set of commands can be found [here], or [the documentation].

## Advanced Topics

The [official Redis command documentation]
does a great job of explaining each command in detail. redis-py attempts
to adhere to the official command syntax. There are a few exceptions:

-   **MULTI/EXEC**: These are implemented as part of the Pipeline class.
