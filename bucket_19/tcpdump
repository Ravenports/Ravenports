[FILE:511:descriptions/desc.primary]
Tcpdump is primarily a network monitoring and management utility that
captures and records TCP/IP data on the run time. Tcpdump is designed to
provide statistics about the number of packets received and captured at
the operating node for network performance analysis, debugging and
diagnosing network bottlenecks and other network oriented tasks.

Because it is a command line utility, data retrieved through tcpdump can
vary. For example, when used with -A operator, it prints out each packet
in ASCII format.
