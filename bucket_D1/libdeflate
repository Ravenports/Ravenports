[FILE:521:descriptions/desc.primary]
libdeflate is a library for fast, whole-buffer DEFLATE-based compression
and decompression.  The supported formats are:

  - DEFLATE (raw)
  - zlib (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a zlib wrapper)
  - gzip (a.k.a. DEFLATE with a gzip wrapper)

libdeflate is heavily optimized.  It is significantly faster than the zlib
library, both for compression and decompression, and especially on x86
processors.  In addition, libdeflate offers optional high compression modes
that provide a better compression ratio than the zlib's "level 9".
