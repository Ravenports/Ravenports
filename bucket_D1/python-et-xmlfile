et_xmfile
=========

et_xmlfile is a low memory library for creating large XML files.

It is based upon the [xmlfile module from lxml] with the aim of allowing
code to be developed that will work with both libraries. It was developed
initially for the openpyxl project but is now a standalone module.

The code was written by Elias Rabel as part of the `Python DÃ¼sseldorf
<http://pyddf.de>`_ openpyxl sprint in September 2014.

Note on performance
-------------------

The code was not developed with performance in mind but turned out to be
faster than the existing SAX-based implementation but is significantly
slower than lxml's xmlfile. There is one area where an optimisation for
lxml will negatively affect the performance of et_xmfile and that is when
using the `.element()` method on an xmlfile context manager. It is,
therefore, recommended not to use this, though the method is provided for
code compatibility.
