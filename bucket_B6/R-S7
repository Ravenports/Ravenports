S7: An Object Oriented System Meant to Become a Successor to S3 andS4

A new object oriented programming system designed to be a successor to S3
and S4. It includes formal class, generic, and method specification, and a
limited form of multiple dispatch. It has been designed and implemented
collaboratively by the R Consortium Object-Oriented Programming Working
Group, which includes representatives from R-Core, 'Bioconductor',
'Posit'/'tidyverse', and the wider R community.
