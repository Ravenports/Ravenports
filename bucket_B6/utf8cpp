[FILE:1075:descriptions/desc.single]
C++ developers miss an easy and portable way of handling Unicode encoded
strings. The original C++ Standard (known as C++98 or C++03) is Unicode
agnostic. C++11 provides some support for Unicode on core language and
library level: u8, u, and U character and string literals, char16_t and
char32_t character types, u16string and u32string library classes, and
codecvt support for conversions between Unicode encoding forms. In the
meantime, developers use third party libraries like ICU, OS specific
capabilities, or simply roll out their own solutions.

In order to easily handle UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings, I came up with a
small, C++98 compatible generic library. For anybody used to work with STL
algorithms and iterators, it should be easy and natural to use. The code is
freely available for any purpose - check out the license. The library has
been used a lot in the past ten years both in commercial and open-source
projects and is considered feature-complete now. If you run into bugs or
performance issues, please let me know and I'll do my best to address them.
