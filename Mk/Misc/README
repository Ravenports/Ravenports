The conspiracy_variants file lists each port by bucket and namebase
and provides a list of variants.

It is generated during the process of publishing an update to Ravenports
and is primarily used during "all ports" prescan.  The list is sorted by
the unique namebase field.

It is formatted as follows:
<2-hexidecimal digit bucket> <namebase> <integer: number of variants> <var1> <var2> ... <varN>

e.g.

9E nawk 1 standard
