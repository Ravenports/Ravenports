The conspiracy_variants file lists each port by bucket and namebase
and provides a list of variants.

It is generated during the process of publishing an update to Ravenports
and is primarily used during "all ports" prescan.  The list is sorted by
the unique namebase field.

It is formatted as follows:
<2-hexidecimal digit bucket> <namebase> <integer: number of variants> <var1> <var2> ... <varN>

e.g.

9E nawk 1 standard


The fpc_equivalents file lists each port by namebase, its version, and the
third field is the  equivalent FreeBSD Ports Collection entry.  An
exception is for generated ports which registers "generated".  If a port
has no equivalent and is not generated, the third field is set as "N/A".

The pupose of the fpc_equivalents file is to provide an input file for a
script to compare the Ravenport port versions with the FPC port versions
as a simple way of detecting out of date ports.
