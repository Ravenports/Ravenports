This directory contains stock, non-template licenses.  If a license file is
provided by the distribution file, that file should be used.  These stock
licenses are here in case the distribution only provides license terms only
references the license itself.  In that case, the port may indicate "stock"
and the appropriate license will be included in the indicated subpackage.
