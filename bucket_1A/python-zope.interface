This package is intended to be independently reusable in any Python
project. It is maintained by the [Zope Toolkit project
].

This package provides an implementation of "object interfaces" for Python.
Interfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a given
API or contract. So, this package can be considered as implementation of
the `Design By Contract`_ methodology support in Python.

.. _Design By Contract: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract

 Changes
=========

6.1 (2023-10-05)
================

- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.12.

- Add support for Python 3.12.

- Fix building of the docs for non-final versions.

6.0 (2023-03-17)
================

- Build Linux binary wheels for Python 3.11.

- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.

- Fix test deprecation warning on Python 3.11.

- Add preliminary support for Python 3.12 as of 3.12a5.

- Drop:

    + `zope.interface.implements`
    + `zope.interface.implementsOnly`
    + `zope.interface.classProvides`

5.5.2 (2022-11-17)
==================

- Add support for building arm64 wheels on macOS.

5.5.1 (2022-11-03)
==================

- Add support for final Python 3.11 release.

5.5.0 (2022-10-10)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 (as of 3.11.0rc2).

- Add missing Trove classifier showing support for Python 3.9.

- Add some more entries to ``zope.interface.interfaces.__all__``.

- Disable unsafe math optimizations in C code.  See [pull request 262
 ].

5.4.0 (2021-04-15)
==================

- Make the C implementation of the __providedBy__ descriptor stop
  ignoring all errors raised when accessing the instance's
  __provides__. Now it behaves like the Python version and only
  catches AttributeError. The previous behaviour could lead to
  crashing the interpreter in cases of recursion and errors. See
  [issue 239].

- Update the ``repr() and str()`` of various objects to be shorter
  and more informative. In many cases, the ``repr()`` is now something
  that can be evaluated to produce an equal object. For example, what
  was previously printed as ``<implementedBy builtins.list> is now
  shown as classImplements(list, IMutableSequence, IIterable)``. See
  [issue 236].

- Make ``Declaration.__add__`` (as in ``implementedBy(Cls) +
  ISomething``) try harder to preserve a consistent resolution order
  when the two arguments share overlapping pieces of the interface
  inheritance hierarchy. Previously, the right hand side was always
  put at the end of the resolution order, which could easily produce
  invalid orders. See [issue 193
 ].
