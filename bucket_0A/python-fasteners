Fasteners
=========

[Documentation status]
[Latest version]

Cross-platform locks for threads and processes.

ðŸ”© Install
----------

`
pip install fasteners
`

ðŸ”© Usage
--------
Lock for processes has the same API as the 
[threading.Lock]
for threads:
```python
import fasteners
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()                                 # for threads
lock = fasteners.InterProcessLock('path/to/lock.file')  # for processes

with lock:
    ... # exclusive access

# or alternatively    

lock.acquire()
... # exclusive access
lock.release()
```

Reader Writer lock has a similar API, which is the same for threads or
processes:

```python
import fasteners

rw_lock = fasteners.ReaderWriterLock()                                 #
for threads
rw_lock = fasteners.InterProcessReaderWriterLock('path/to/lock.file')  #
for processes

with rw_lock.write_lock():
    ... # write access

with rw_lock.read_lock():
    ... # read access

# or alternatively

rw_lock.acquire_read_lock()
... # read access
rw_lock.release_read_lock()

rw_lock.acquire_write_lock()
... # write access
rw_lock.release_write_lock()
```

ðŸ”© Overview
-----------

Python standard library provides a lock for threads (both a reentrant one,
and a
non-reentrant one, see below). Fasteners extends this, and provides a lock
for
processes, as well as Reader Writer locks for both threads and processes.
Definitions of terms used in this overview can be found in the
[glossary].

The specifics of the locks are as follows:

### Process locks

The `fasteners.InterProcessLock` uses [fcntl] on Unix-like systems and 
msvc [_locking] on Windows. 
As a result, if used cross-platform it guarantees an intersection of their
features:

| lock | reentrant | mandatory |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| fcntl                        | âœ˜ | âœ˜ |
| _locking                     | âœ” | âœ” |
| fasteners.InterProcessLock   | âœ˜ | âœ˜ |

The `fasteners.InterProcessReaderWriterLock` also uses fcntl on Unix-like
systems and 
[LockFileEx] on Windows. Their 
features are as follows:

| lock | reentrant | mandatory | upgradable | preference | 
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| fcntl                                    | âœ˜ | âœ˜ | âœ” | reader |
| LockFileEx                               | âœ” | âœ” | âœ˜ | reader |
