Getting Started
---------------
Assuming that you have Python and virtualenv installed, set up your
environment and install the required dependencies like this or you can
install the library using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/boto/botocore.git
    $ cd botocore
    $ virtualenv venv
    ...
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -e .

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install botocore

Using Botocore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After installing botocore

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.aws/credentials``):

.. code-block:: ini

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET

Then, set up a default region (in e.g. ``~/.aws/config``):

.. code-block:: ini

   [default]
   region=us-east-1

Other credentials configuration method can be found [here]

Then, from a Python interpreter:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import botocore.session
    >>> session = botocore.session.get_session()
    >>> client = session.create_client('ec2')
    >>> print(client.describe_instances())
