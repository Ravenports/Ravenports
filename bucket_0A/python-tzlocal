tzlocal
=======

API CHANGE!
-----------

With version 3.0 of tzlocal, tzlocal no longer returned `pytz` objects, but
`zoneinfo` objects, which has a different API. Since 4.0, it now restored
partial compatibility for `pytz` users through Paul Ganssle's
`pytz_deprecation_shim`.

tzlocal 4.0 also adds an official function `get_localzone_name()` to get
only
the timezone name, instead of a timezone object. On unix, it can raise an
error if you don't have a timezone name configured, where `get_localzone()`
will succeed, so only use that if you need the timezone name.

4.0 also adds way more information on what is going wrong in your
configuration when the configuration files are unclear or contradictory.

Version 5.0 removes the `pytz_deprecation_shim`, and now only returns
`zoneinfo` objects, like verion 3.0 did. If you need `pytz` objects, you
have
to stay on version 4.0. If there are bugs in version 4.0, I will release
updates, but there will be no further functional changes on the 4.x branch.

Info
----

This Python module returns the [IANA time zone name
] for your local time zone or a tzinfo
object with the local timezone information, under Unix and Windows.

This module attempts to fix a glaring hole in the pytz and zoneinfo
modules, that there is no way to get the local timezone information, unless
you know the zoneinfo name, and under several Linux distros that's hard or
impossible to figure out.

With tzlocal you only need to call ``get_localzone() and you will get a
tzinfo`` object with the local time zone info. On some Unices you will
still not get to know what the timezone name is, but you don't need that
when
you have the tzinfo file. However, if the timezone name is readily
available
it will be used.

What it's not for
-----------------

It's not for converting the current time between UTC and your local time.
There are
other, simpler ways of doing this. This is if you need to know things like
the name
of the time zone, or if you need to be able to convert between your time
zone and
another time zone for times that are in the future or in the past.

For current time conversions to and from UTC, look in the Python time
module.

Supported systems
-----------------

These are the systems that are in theory supported:

 * Windows 2000 and later

 * Any unix-like system with a ``/etc/localtime or
/usr/local/etc/localtime``

If you have one of the above systems and it does not work, it's a bug.
Please report it.

Please note that if you are getting a time zone called local, this is not
a bug, it's actually the main feature of tzlocal, that even if your
system does NOT have a configuration file with the zoneinfo name of your
time
zone, it will still work.

You can also use tzlocal to get the name of your local timezone, but only
if your system is configured to make that possible. tzlocal looks for the
timezone name in ``/etc/timezone``, ``/var/db/zoneinfo``,
``/etc/sysconfig/clock and /etc/conf.d/clock``. If your
``/etc/localtime`` is a symlink it can also extract the name from that
symlink.

If you need the name of your local time zone, then please make sure your
system is properly configured to allow that.

If your unix system doesn't have a timezone configured, tzlocal will
default
to UTC.

Notes on Docker
---------------

It turns out that Docker images frequently have broken timezone setups.
This usually results in a warning that the configuration is wrong, or that
the timezone offset doesn't match the found timezone.
