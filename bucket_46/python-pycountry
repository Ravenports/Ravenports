=========
pycountry
=========

pycountry provides the ISO databases for the standards:

639-3
  Languages

3166
  Countries

3166-3
  Deleted countries

3166-2
  Subdivisions of countries

4217
  Currencies

15924
  Scripts

The package includes a copy from Debian's `pkg-isocodes` and makes the data
accessible through a Python API.

Translation files for the various strings are included as well.

Data update policy
==================

No changes to the data will be accepted into pycountry. This is a pure
wrapper
around the ISO standard using the `pkg-isocodes` database from Debian *as
is*.
If you need changes to the politicial situation in the world, please talk
to
the ISO or Debian people, not me.

Donations / Monetary Support
============================

This is a small project that I maintain in my personal time. I am not
interested in personal financial gain. However, if you would like to
support
the project then I would love if you would donate to `Feminist Frequency
<https://feministfrequency.com/donate/>`_ instead. Also, let the world
know you
did so, so that others can follow your path.

Contributions
=============

The code lives in a `bitbucket Mercurial repository
<https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/pycountry>`_, and issues must be
reported in
`project bugtracker
<https://bitbucket.org/flyingcircus/pycountry/issues?status=new&status=open
>`_.

Countries (ISO 3166)
====================

Countries are accessible through a database object that is already
configured
upon import of pycountry and works as an iterable:

  >>> import pycountry
  >>> len(pycountry.countries)
  249
  >>> list(pycountry.countries)[0]
  Country(alpha_2='AF', alpha_3='AFG', name='Afghanistan', numeric='004',
official_name='Islamic Republic of Afghanistan')

Specific countries can be looked up by their various codes and provide the
information included in the standard as attributes:

  >>> germany = pycountry.countries.get(alpha_2='DE')
  >>> germany
  Country(alpha_2='DE', alpha_3='DEU', name='Germany', numeric='276',
official_name='Federal Republic of Germany')
  >>> germany.alpha_2
  'DE'
  >>> germany.alpha_3
  'DEU'
  >>> germany.numeric
  '276'
  >>> germany.name
  'Germany'
  >>> germany.official_name
  'Federal Republic of Germany'

The `historic_countries` database contains former countries that have been
removed from the standard and are now included in ISO 3166-3, excluding
existing ones:

 >>> ussr = pycountry.historic_countries.get(alpha_3='SUN')
 >>> ussr
 Country(alpha_3='SUN', alpha_4='SUHH', withdrawal_date='1992-08-30',
name='USSR, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics', numeric='810')
 >>> ussr.alpha_4
 'SUHH'
 >>> ussr.alpha_3
 'SUN'
 >>> ussr.name
 'USSR, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'
 >>> ussr.withdrawal_date
 '1992-08-30'
