pycountry provides the ISO databases for the standards:

-  `639-3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3>`_ Languages
-  [3166] Codes for
   representation of names of countries and their subdivisions
-  `3166-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`_ Countries
-  `3166-3 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-3>`_ Deleted
   countries
-  `3166-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2>`_ Subdivisions of
   countries
-  [4217] Currencies
-  [15924] Scripts

The package includes a copy from Debian's `pkg-isocodes
<https://salsa.debian.org/iso-codes-team/iso-codes>`_ and makes the data
accessible through a Python API.

Translation files for the various strings are included as well.

********************
 Data update policy
********************

No changes to the data will be accepted into pycountry. This is a pure
wrapper around the ISO standard using the ``pkg-isocodes`` database from
Debian *as is*. If you need changes to the political situation in the
world, please talk to the ISO or Debian people, not me.

******************************
 Donations / Monetary Support
******************************

This is a small project that I maintain in my personal time. I am not
interested in personal financial gain. However, if you would like to
support the project then I would love if you would donate to [Feminist
Frequency] instead. Also, let
the world know you did so, so that others can follow your path.

***************
 Contributions
***************

The code lives in a [git repository on GitHub
], and issues must be reported
in there as well.

************************
 Countries (ISO 3166-1)
************************

Countries are accessible through a database object that is already
configured upon import of pycountry and works as an iterable:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> import pycountry
   >>> len(pycountry.countries)
   249
   >>> list(pycountry.countries)[0]
   Country(alpha_2='AF', alpha_3='AFG', name='Afghanistan', numeric='004',
official_name='Islamic Republic of Afghanistan')

Specific countries can be looked up by their various codes and provide
the information included in the standard as attributes:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> germany = pycountry.countries.get(alpha_2='DE')
   >>> germany
   Country(alpha_2='DE', alpha_3='DEU', name='Germany', numeric='276',
official_name='Federal Republic of Germany')
   >>> germany.alpha_2
   'DE'
   >>> germany.alpha_3
   'DEU'
   >>> germany.numeric
   '276'
   >>> germany.name
   'Germany'
   >>> germany.official_name
   'Federal Republic of Germany'

There's also a "fuzzy" search to help people discover "proper" countries
for names that might only actually be subdivisions. The fuzziness also
includes normalizing unicode accents. There's also a bit of
prioritization included to prefer matches on country names before
subdivision names and have countries with more matches be listed before
ones with fewer matches:

.. code:: pycon

   >>> pycountry.countries.search_fuzzy('England')
