Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It
uses
the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard
library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been
executed.

Coverage.py runs on many versions of Python:

* CPython 2.7.
* CPython 3.5 through 3.9 alpha 2.
* PyPy2 7.0 and PyPy3 7.0.

Documentation is on `Read the Docs`_.  Code repository and issue tracker
are on
`GitHub`_.

**New in 5.0:** SQLite data storage, JSON report, contexts, relative
filenames,
dropped support for Python 2.6, 3.3 and 3.4.
