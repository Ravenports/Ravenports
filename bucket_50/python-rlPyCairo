This is a plugin for the ReportLab PDF Toolkit.
which constructs rich PDF documents, and also creation
of charts in a variety of bitmap and vector formats.

This plugin is intended to replace most of the usage of the
libart based C extension _renderPM which has been shown to
have issues when rendering complex documents.

This backend can be brought into use by setting 
reportlab.rl_config.renderPMBackend = 'rlPyCairo'
any of the methods detailed in reportlab/rl_config.py
can be used to accomplish this.

The new backend seems able to handle all the same behaviour as
_renderPM and the only place where it seems inferior is in the
rendering of scaled images and the speed with which it draws
text.

At present the rlPyCairo backend only uses the _renderPM extension 
to use its mapping of ReportLab font names to extract paths for
rendering this is no doubt the reason for its slowness when
rendering text.

Currently we are not making use of any of the more advanced 
abilities of PyCairo such as transparency, patterns etc,
but that may change in the future.
