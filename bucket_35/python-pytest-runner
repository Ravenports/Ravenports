Setup scripts can use pytest-runner to add setup.py test support for pytest
runner.

Deprecation Notice
==================

pytest-runner depends on deprecated features of setuptools and relies on
features that break security
mechanisms in pip. For example 'setup_requires' and 'tests_require' bypass
``pip --require-hashes``.
See also `pypa/setuptools#1684
<https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1684>`_.

It is recommended that you:

- Remove ``'pytest-runner' from your setup_requires``, preferably removing
the setup_requires option.
- Remove 'pytest' and any other testing requirements from tests_require,
preferably removing the tests_requires option.
- Select a tool to bootstrap and then run tests such as tox.

Usage
=====

- Add 'pytest-runner' to your 'setup_requires'. Pin to '>=2.0,<3dev' (or
  similar) to avoid pulling in incompatible versions.
- Include 'pytest' and any other testing requirements to 'tests_require'.
- Invoke tests with ``setup.py pytest``.
- Pass ``--index-url`` to have test requirements downloaded from an
alternate
  index URL (unnecessary if specified for easy_install in setup.cfg).
- Pass additional py.test command-line options using ``--addopts``.
- Set permanent options for the ``python setup.py pytest`` command (like
``index-url``)
  in the ``[pytest] section of setup.cfg``.
- Set permanent options for the ``py.test`` run (like addopts or
pep8ignore) in the ``[pytest]
  section of pytest.ini or tox.ini or put them in the [tool:pytest]
  section of setup.cfg``. See [pytest issue 567
 ].
- Optionally, set ``test=pytest in the [aliases] section of setup.cfg
  to cause python setup.py test`` to invoke pytest.

Example
=======

The most simple usage looks like this in setup.py::

    setup(
        setup_requires=[
            'pytest-runner',
       ],
        tests_require=[
            'pytest',
       ],
    )

Additional dependencies require to run the tests (e.g. mock or pytest
plugins) may be added to tests_require and will be downloaded and
required by the session before invoking pytest.

Follow [this search on github
]
for examples of real-world usage.

Standalone Example
==================

This technique is deprecated - if you have standalone scripts
you wish to invoke with dependencies, `use pip-run
<https://pypi.org/project/pip-run>`_.

Although ``pytest-runner`` is typically used to add pytest test
runner support to maintained packages, ``pytest-runner`` may
also be used to create standalone tests. Consider [this example
failure],
reported in `jsonpickle #117
<https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/issues/117>`_
or [this MongoDB test
]
demonstrating a technique that works even when dependencies
are required in the test.

Either example file may be cloned or downloaded and simply run on
any system with Python and Setuptools. It will download the
specified dependencies and run the tests. Afterward, the the
cloned directory can be removed and with it all trace of
invoking the test. No other dependencies are needed and no
system configuration is altered.

Then, anyone trying to replicate the failure can do so easily
and with all the power of pytest (rewritten assertions,
rich comparisons, interactive debugging, extensibility through
plugins, etc).
