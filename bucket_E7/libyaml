[FILE:1029:descriptions/desc.primary]
LibYAML is a YAML 1.1 parser and emitter written in C.

LibYAML covers presenting and parsing processes. Thus LibYAML defines the
following two processors:
   * Parser, which takes an input stream of bytes and produces a sequence
     of parsing events.
   * Emitter, which takes a sequence of events and produces a stream of
     bytes.

The processes of parsing and presenting are inverse to each other. Any
sequence of events produced by parsing a well-formed YAML document should
be acceptable by the Emitter, which should produce an equivalent document.
Similarly, any document produced by emitting a sequence of events should
be acceptable for the Parser, which should produce an equivalent sequence
of events.

The job of resolving implicit tags, composing and serializing
representation trees, as well as constructing and representing native
objects is left to applications and bindings. Although some of these
processes may be covered in the latter releases, they are not in the scope
of the initial release of LibYAML.
