A comprehensive HTTP client library, httplib2 supports many features left
out of other HTTP libraries.

**HTTP and HTTPS**
  HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was compiled with
SSL support.

**Keep-Alive**
  Supports HTTP 1.1 Keep-Alive, keeping the socket open and performing
multiple requests over the same connection if possible.

**Authentication**
  The following three types of HTTP Authentication are supported. These can
be used over both HTTP and HTTPS.

  * Digest
  * Basic
  * WSSE

**Caching**
  The module can optionally operate with a private cache that understands
the Cache-Control:
  header and uses both the ETag and Last-Modified cache validators. Both
file system
  and memcached based caches are supported.

**All Methods**
  The module can handle any HTTP request method, not just GET and POST.

**Redirects**
  Automatically follows 3XX redirects on GETs.

**Compression**
  Handles both 'deflate' and 'gzip' types of compression.

**Lost update support**
  Automatically adds back ETags into PUT requests to resources we have
already cached. This implements Section 3.2 of Detecting the Lost Update
Problem Using Unreserved Checkout

**Unit Tested**
  A large and growing set of unit tests.
