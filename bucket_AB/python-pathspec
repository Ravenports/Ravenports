PathSpec
========

*pathspec* is a utility library for pattern matching of file paths. So far
this
only includes Git's `gitignore`_ pattern matching.

.. _`gitignore`: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

Tutorial
--------

Say you have a "Projects" directory and you want to back it up, but only
certain files, and ignore others depending on certain conditions::

	>>> from pathspec import PathSpec
	>>> # The gitignore-style patterns for files to select, but we're
including
	>>> # instead of ignoring.
	>>> spec_text = """
	...
	... # This is a comment because the line begins with a hash: "#"
	...
	... # Include several project directories (and all descendants) relative
to
	... # the current directory. To reference only a directory you must end
with a
	... # slash: "/"
	... /project-a/
	... /project-b/
	... /project-c/
	...
	... # Patterns can be negated by prefixing with exclamation mark: "!"
	...
	... # Ignore temporary files beginning or ending with "~" and ending with
	... # ".swp".
	... !~*
	... !*~
	... !*.swp
	...
	... # These are python projects so ignore compiled python files from
	... # testing.
	... !*.pyc
	...
	... # Ignore the build directories but only directly under the project
	... # directories.
	... !/*/build/
	...
	... """

The PathSpec class provides an abstraction around pattern implementations,
and we want to compile our patterns as "gitignore" patterns. You could call
it a
wrapper for a list of compiled patterns::

	>>> spec = PathSpec.from_lines('gitignore', spec_text.splitlines())

If we wanted to manually compile the patterns, we can use the
GitIgnoreBasicPattern
class directly. It is used in the background for "gitignore" which
internally
converts patterns to regular expressions::

	>>> from pathspec.patterns.gitignore.basic import GitIgnoreBasicPattern
	>>> patterns = map(GitIgnoreBasicPattern, spec_text.splitlines())
	>>> spec = PathSpec(patterns)

``PathSpec.from_lines()`` is a class method which simplifies that.

If you want to load the patterns from file, you can pass the file object
directly as well::

	>>> with open('patterns.list', 'r') as fh:
	>>>     spec = PathSpec.from_lines('gitignore', fh)

You can perform matching on a whole directory tree with::

	>>> matches = set(spec.match_tree_files('path/to/directory'))

Or you can perform matching on a specific set of file paths with::

	>>> matches = set(spec.match_files(file_paths))

Or check to see if an individual file matches::

	>>> is_matched = spec.match_file(file_path)

There's actually two implementations of "gitignore". The basic
implementation is
used by PathSpec and follows patterns as documented by `gitignore`_.
However, Git's behavior differs from the documented patterns. There's some
edge-cases, and in particular, Git allows including files from excluded
directories which appears to contradict the documentation. GitIgnoreSpec
handles these cases to more closely replicate Git's behavior::

	>>> from pathspec import GitIgnoreSpec
	>>> spec = GitIgnoreSpec.from_lines(spec_text.splitlines())

You do not specify the style of pattern for GitIgnoreSpec because it should
