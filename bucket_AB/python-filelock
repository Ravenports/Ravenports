# py-filelock

![travis-ci]

This package contains a single module, which implements a platform
independent
file lock in Python, which provides a simple way of inter-process
communication:

```Python
from filelock import Timeout, FileLock

lock = FileLock("high_ground.txt.lock")
with lock:
    open("high_ground.txt", "a").write("You were the chosen one.")        
```

**Don't use** a *FileLock* to lock the file you want to write to, instead
create
a separate *.lock* file as shown above.

## Installation

*py-filelock* is available via PyPi:

```
$ pip3 install filelock
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the API is available on
[readthedocs.org].

### Examples

A *FileLock* is used to indicate another process of your application that a
resource or working
directory is currently used. To do so, create a *FileLock* first:

```Python
from filelock import Timeout, FileLock

file_path = "high_ground.txt"
lock_path = "high_ground.txt.lock"

lock = FileLock(lock_path, timeout=1)
```

The lock object supports multiple ways for acquiring the lock, including
the
ones used to acquire standard Python thread locks:

```Python
with lock:
    open(file_path, "a").write("Hello there!")

lock.acquire()
try:
    open(file_path, "a").write("General Kenobi!")
finally:
    lock.release()
```

The *acquire()* method accepts also a *timeout* parameter. If the lock
cannot be
acquired within *timeout* seconds, a *Timeout* exception is raised:

```Python
try:
    with lock.acquire(timeout=10):
        open(file_path, "a").write("I have a bad feeling about this.")
except Timeout:
    print("Another instance of this application currently holds the lock.")
```

The lock objects are recursive locks, which means that once acquired, they
will
not block on successive lock requests:

```Python
def cite1():
    with lock:
        open(file_path, "a").write("I hate it when he does that.")

def cite2():
    with lock:
        open(file_path, "a").write("You don't want to sell me death
sticks.")
