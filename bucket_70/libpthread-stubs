[FILE:651:descriptions/desc.single]
This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided in
libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely on
pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when linked
to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on platforms
which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.  On platforms which
already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this package ships only
the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow libraries to unconditionally
express a dependency on pthread-stubs and still obtain correct behavior.
