warp: Group Dates

Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods including: yearly, monthly,
by second, by week of the month, and more. The groups are defined in such a
way that they also represent the distance between dates in terms of the
period. This extracts valuable information that can be used in further
calculations that rely on a specific temporal spacing between observations.
