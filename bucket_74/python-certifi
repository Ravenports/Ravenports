Certifi: Python SSL Certificates
================================

`Certifi`_ provides Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root
Certificates for
validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the
identity
of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the `Requests`_ project.

Installation
------------

certifi is available on PyPI. Simply install it with pip::

    $ pip install certifi

Usage
-----

To reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use
the
built-in function::

    >>> import certifi

    >>> certifi.where()
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'

Or from the command line::

    $ python -m certifi
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem

Enjoy!

1024-bit Root Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Browsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys are
unacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For
this
reason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from
its
bundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater
key)
certificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates
from
its bundle, certifi removed them as well.

In previous versions, certifi provided the ``certifi.old_where()`` function
to intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle. This was
not
recommended in production and therefore was removed at the end of 2018.

Addition/Removal of Certificates
--------------------------------

Certifi does not support any addition/removal or other modification of the
CA trust store content. This project is intended to provide a reliable and
highly portable root of trust to python deployments. Look to upstream
projects
for methods to use alternate trust.
