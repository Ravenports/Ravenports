![mkdocstrings_gif1]

## Features

- [**Language-agnostic:**]
  just like *MkDocs*, *mkdocstrings* is written in Python but is
language-agnostic.
  It means you can use it with any programming language, as long as there
is a
  [**handler**] for it.
  We currently have [handlers]
  for the [Crystal], [Python],
  and [VBA] languages,
  as well as for [shell scripts/libraries].
  Maybe you'd like to add another one to the list? :wink:

- [**Multiple themes support:**]
  each handler can offer multiple themes. Currently, we offer the
  :star: [Material theme] :star:
  as well as basic support for the ReadTheDocs and MkDocs themes for the
Python handler.

- [**Cross-references across pages:**]
  *mkdocstrings* makes it possible to reference headings in other Markdown
files with the classic Markdown linking
  syntax: `[identifier][]` or `[title][identifier]` -- and you don't need
to remember which exact page this object was
  on. This works for any heading that's produced by a *mkdocstrings*
language handler, and you can opt to include
  *any* Markdown heading into the global referencing scheme.

    **Note**: in versions prior to 0.15 *all* Markdown headers were
included, but now you need to
    [opt in].

- [**Cross-references across sites:**]
  similarly to [Sphinx's intersphinx extension],
  *mkdocstrings* can reference API items from other libraries, given they
provide an inventory and you load
  that inventory in your MkDocs configuration.

- [**Inline injection in Markdown:**]
  instead of generating Markdown files, *mkdocstrings* allows you to inject
  documentation anywhere in your Markdown contents. The syntax is simple:
`::: identifier` followed by a 4-spaces
  indented YAML block. The identifier and YAML configuration will be passed
to the appropriate handler
  to collect and render documentation.

- [**Global and local configuration:**]
  each handler can be configured globally in `mkdocs.yml`, and locally for
each
  "autodoc" instruction.

- **Reasonable defaults:**
  you should be able to just drop the plugin in your configuration and
enjoy your auto-generated docs.

## Used by

*mkdocstrings* is used by well-known companies, projects and scientific
teams:
[Ansible],
[Apache],
[Google],
[Jitsi],
[Microsoft],
[Prefect],
[Pydantic],
[and more...]

## Installation

With `pip`:

`bash
pip install mkdocstrings
`

You can install support for specific languages using extras, for example:

```bash
pip install 'mkdocstrings[crystal,python]'
```
