What is it?
-----------

Distlib is a library which implements low-level functions that relate to
packaging and distribution of Python software. It is intended to be used as
the
basis for third-party packaging tools. The documentation is available at

https://distlib.readthedocs.io/

Main features
-------------

Distlib currently offers the following features:

* The package ``distlib.database``, which implements a database of
installed
  distributions, as defined by :pep:`376`, and distribution dependency
graph
  logic. Support is also provided for non-installed distributions (i.e.
  distributions registered with metadata on an index like PyPI), including
  the ability to scan for dependencies and building dependency graphs.
* The package ``distlib.index``, which implements an interface to perform
  operations on an index, such as registering a project, uploading a
  distribution or uploading documentation. Support is included for
verifying
  SSL connections (with domain matching) and signing/verifying packages
using
  GnuPG.
* The package ``distlib.metadata``, which implements distribution metadata
as
  defined by :pep:`643`, :pep:`566`, :pep:`345`, :pep:`314` and :pep:`241`.
* The package ``distlib.markers``, which implements environment markers as
  defined by :pep:`508`.
* The package ``distlib.manifest``, which implements lists of files used
  in packaging source distributions.
* The package ``distlib.locators``, which allows finding distributions,
whether
  on PyPI (XML-RPC or via the "simple" interface), local directories or
some
  other source.
* The package ``distlib.resources``, which allows access to data files
stored
  in Python packages, both in the file system and in .zip files.
* The package ``distlib.scripts``, which allows installing of scripts with
  adjustment of shebang lines and support for native Windows executable
  launchers.
* The package ``distlib.version``, which implements version specifiers as
  defined by :pep:`440`, but also support for working with "legacy"
versions and
  semantic versions.
* The package ``distlib.wheel``, which provides support for building and
  installing from the Wheel format for binary distributions (see
:pep:`427`).
* The package ``distlib.util``, which contains miscellaneous functions and
  classes which are useful in packaging, but which do not fit neatly into
  one of the other packages in distlib.* The package implements enhanced
  globbing functionality such as the ability to use ``**`` in patterns to
  specify recursing into subdirectories.

Python version and platform compatibility
-----------------------------------------

Distlib is intended to be used on and is tested on Python versions 2.7 and
3.6 or later,
pypy-2.7 and pypy3 on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Project status
--------------

The project has reached a mature status in its development: there is a
comprehensive
test suite and it has been exercised on Windows, Ubuntu and macOS. The
project is used
by well-known projects such as [pip] and [caniusepython3
].

This project was migrated from Mercurial to Git and from BitBucket to
GitHub, and
although all information of importance has been retained across the
migration, some
commit references in issues and issue comments may have become invalid.

Code of Conduct
---------------

Everyone interacting in the distlib project's codebases, issue trackers,
chat
rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the `PyPA Code of Conduct`_.
