[FILE:519:descriptions/desc.primary]
The xfdesktop application manages the desktop backdrop. It sets a backdrop 
image and/or color and it can pop up an applications menu and a list of 
all running applications when you click on the desktop with the right or 
middle mouse button respectively. As of Xfce 4.4, xfdesktop also draws 
icons on the desktop.

The xfdesktop package installs a settings dialog for use with the Settings 
Manager. From this dialog you can change the backdrop image and color and 
change settings for the menu and the window list.
