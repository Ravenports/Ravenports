You can find alternatives to django-mptt on
[Django Packages].
Maybe you do not need MPTT, especially when using newer databases. See
`django-tree-queries <https://github.com/matthiask/django-tree-queries>`_
for an
implementation using recursive Common Table Expressions (CTE). Here's its
[announcement blog post].

Utilities for implementing Modified Preorder Tree Traversal with your
Django Models and working with trees of Model instances.

What is Modified Preorder Tree Traversal?
=========================================

MPTT is a technique for storing hierarchical data in a database. The aim is
to
make retrieval operations very efficient.

The trade-off for this efficiency is that performing inserts and moving
items around the tree are more involved, as there's some extra work
required to keep the tree structure in a good state at all times.

Here are a few articles about MPTT to whet your appetite and provide
details about how the technique itself works:

* `Trees in SQL`_
* `Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database`_
* `Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL`_

.. _`Trees in SQL`:

.. _`Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database`:
https://www.sitepoint.com/hierarchical-data-database/
.. _`Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL`:

What is ``django-mptt``?
========================

``django-mptt`` is a reusable Django app that aims to make it easy for you
to use MPTT with your own Django models.

It takes care of the details of managing a database table as a tree
structure and provides tools for working with trees of model instances.

Requirements
------------

* A supported version of Python:
https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions
* A supported version of Django:
https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions

Feature overview
----------------

* Simple registration of models - fields required for tree structure will
be
  added automatically.

* The tree structure is automatically updated when you create or delete
  model instances, or change an instance's parent.

* Each level of the tree is automatically sorted by a field (or fields) of
your
  choice.

* New model methods are added to each registered model for:

  * changing position in the tree
  * retrieving ancestors, siblings, descendants
  * counting descendants
  * other tree-related operations

* A TreeManager manager is added to all registered models. This provides
  methods to:

  * move nodes around a tree, or into a different tree
  * insert a node anywhere in a tree
  * rebuild the MPTT fields for the tree (useful when you do bulk updates
    outside of Django)

* `Form fields`_ for tree models.

* `Utility functions`_ for tree models.
