## Modules

- [DeepDiff]: Deep Difference of dictionaries, iterables, strings, and ANY
other object.
- [DeepSearch]: Search for objects within other objects.
- [DeepHash]: Hash any object based on their content.
- [Delta]: Store the difference of objects and apply them to other objects.
- [Extract]: Extract an item from a nested Python object using its path.
- [commandline]: Use DeepDiff from commandline.

Tested on Python 3.9+ and PyPy3.

- **[Documentation]**

## What is new?

Please check the [ChangeLog] file for the detailed information.

DeepDiff 8-4-2

- fixes the type hints for the base
- fixes summarize so if json dumps fails, we can still get a repr of the
results
- adds ipaddress support

DeepDiff 8-4-1

- Adding BaseOperatorPlus base class for custom operators
- default_timezone can be passed now to set your default timezone to
something other than UTC.
- New summarization algorithm that produces valid json
- Better type hint support
- Breaking change in DeepHash where we raise Exception instead of logging
if we can't hash a value.
- Added the log_stacktrace parameter to DeepDiff. When True, it will log
the stacktrace along with the error.

DeepDiff 8-3-0

- Fixed some static typing issues
- Added the summarize module for better repr of nested values

DeepDiff 8-2-0

- Small optimizations so we don't load functions that are not needed
- Updated the minimum version of Orderly-set 
- Normalize all datetimes into UTC. Assume timezone naive datetimes are
UTC. 

DeepDiff 8-1-0

- Removing deprecated lines from setup.py
- Added `prefix` option to `pretty()`
- Fixes hashing of numpy boolean values.
- Fixes __slots__ comparison when the attribute doesn't exist.
- Relaxing orderly-set reqs
- Added Python 3.13 support
- Only lower if clean_key is instance of str #504
- Fixes issue where the key deep_distance is not returned when both
compared items are equal #510
- Fixes exclude_paths fails to work in certain cases
- exclude_paths fails to work #509
- Fixes to_json() method chokes on standard json.dumps() kwargs such as
sort_keys
- to_dict() method chokes on standard json.dumps() kwargs  #490
- Fixes accessing the affected_root_keys property on the diff object
returned by DeepDiff fails when one of the dicts is empty
- Fixes accessing the affected_root_keys property on the diff object
returned by DeepDiff fails when one of the dicts is empty #508

## Installation

### Install from PyPi:

`pip install deepdiff`

If you want to use DeepDiff from commandline:

`pip install "deepdiff[cli]"`

If you want to improve the performance of DeepDiff with certain
functionalities such as improved json serialization:

`pip install "deepdiff[optimize]"`

Install optional packages:
- [yaml]
- [tomli] (python 3.10 and older) and [tomli-w] for writing
- [clevercsv] for more rubust CSV parsing
- [orjson] for speed and memory optimized parsing
- [pydantic]
