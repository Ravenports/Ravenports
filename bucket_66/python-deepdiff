## Modules

- [DeepDiff]: Deep Difference of dictionaries, iterables, strings, and ANY
other object.
- [DeepSearch]: Search for objects within other objects.
- [DeepHash]: Hash any object based on their content.
- [Delta]: Store the difference of objects and apply them to other objects.
- [Extract]: Extract an item from a nested Python object using its path.
- [commandline]: Use DeepDiff from commandline.

Tested on Python 3.8+ and PyPy3.

- **[Documentation]**

## What is new?

Please check the [ChangeLog] file for the detailed information.

DeepDiff 8-2-0

- Small optimizations so we don't load functions that are not needed
- Updated the minimum version of Orderly-set 
- Normalize all datetimes into UTC. Assume timezone naive datetimes are
UTC. 

DeepDiff 8-1-0

- Removing deprecated lines from setup.py
- Added `prefix` option to `pretty()`
- Fixes hashing of numpy boolean values.
- Fixes __slots__ comparison when the attribute doesn't exist.
- Relaxing orderly-set reqs
- Added Python 3.13 support
- Only lower if clean_key is instance of str #504
- Fixes issue where the key deep_distance is not returned when both
compared items are equal #510
- Fixes exclude_paths fails to work in certain cases
- exclude_paths fails to work #509
- Fixes to_json() method chokes on standard json.dumps() kwargs such as
sort_keys
- to_dict() method chokes on standard json.dumps() kwargs  #490
- Fixes accessing the affected_root_keys property on the diff object
returned by DeepDiff fails when one of the dicts is empty
- Fixes accessing the affected_root_keys property on the diff object
returned by DeepDiff fails when one of the dicts is empty #508

## Installation

### Install from PyPi:

`pip install deepdiff`

If you want to use DeepDiff from commandline:

`pip install "deepdiff[cli]"`

If you want to improve the performance of DeepDiff with certain
functionalities such as improved json serialization:

`pip install "deepdiff[optimize]"`

Install optional packages:
- [yaml]
- [tomli] (python 3.10 and older) and [tomli-w] for writing
- [clevercsv] for more rubust CSV parsing
- [orjson] for speed and memory optimized parsing
- [pydantic]

### A message from Sep, the creator of DeepDiff

> 👋 Hi there,
>
> Thank you for using DeepDiff!
> As an engineer, I understand the frustration of wrestling with **unruly
data** in pipelines.
> That's why I developed a new tool - [Qluster] to empower non-engineers to
control and resolve data issues at scale autonomously and **stop bugging
the engineers**! 🛠️
>
> If you are going through this pain now, I would love to give you [early
access] to Qluster and get your feedback.
