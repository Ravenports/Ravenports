## DeepDiff Overview

- DeepDiff: Deep Difference of dictionaries, iterables, strings and other
objects. It will recursively look for all the changes.
- DeepSearch: Search for objects within other objects.
- DeepHash: Hash any object based on their content.

Tested on Python 3.7+ and PyPy3.

- **[Documentation]**

## What is new?

Please check the [ChangeLog] file for the detailed information.

DeepDiff 6-2-0

- Major improvement in the diff report for lists when items are all
hashable and the order of items is important.

DeepDiff 6-1-0

- DeepDiff.affected_paths can be used to get the list of all paths where a
change, addition, or deletion was reported for.
- DeepDiff.affected_root_keys can be used to get the list of all paths
where a change, addition, or deletion was reported for.  
- Bugfix: ValueError when using Decimal 0.x #339  by [Enric Pou]
- Serialization of UUID 

DeepDiff 6-0-0

- [Exclude obj callback strict] parameter is added to DeepDiff by Mikhail
Khviyuzov [mskhviyu].
- A fix for diffing using `iterable_compare_func` with nested objects by
[dtorres-sf] who originally contributed this feature.

Note: There are no breaking changes in DeepDiff 6 compared to the latest
DeepDiff 5 releases.

## Installation

### Install from PyPi:

`pip install deepdiff`

If you want to use DeepDiff from commandline:

`pip install "deepdiff[cli]"`

### Importing

```python
>>> from deepdiff import DeepDiff  # For Deep Difference of 2 objects
>>> from deepdiff import grep, DeepSearch  # For finding if item exists in
an object
>>> from deepdiff import DeepHash  # For hashing objects based on their
contents
```

Note: if you want to use DeepDiff via commandline, make sure to run `pip
install "deepdiff[cli]"`. Then you can access the commands via:

- DeepDiff
    - `$ deep diff --help`
- Delta
    - `$ deep patch --help`
- grep
    - `$ deep grep --help`
- extract
    - `$ deep extract --help`

# Deep Diff

DeepDiff gets the difference of 2 objects.

## A few Examples

> Note: This is just a brief overview of what DeepDiff can do. Please visit
<https://zepworks.com/deepdiff/6.2.3/> for full documentation.

### List difference ignoring order or duplicates

```python
>>> t1 = {1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:{"a":"hello", "b":[1, 2, 3]}}
>>> t2 = {1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:{"a":"hello", "b":[1, 3, 2, 3]}}
>>> ddiff = DeepDiff(t1, t2, ignore_order=True)
