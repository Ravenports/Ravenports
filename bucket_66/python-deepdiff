## Modules

- [DeepDiff]: Deep Difference of dictionaries, iterables, strings, and ANY
other object.
- [DeepSearch]: Search for objects within other objects.
- [DeepHash]: Hash any object based on their content.
- [Delta]: Store the difference of objects and apply them to other objects.
- [Extract]: Extract an item from a nested Python object using its path.
- [commandline]: Use DeepDiff from commandline.

Tested on Python 3.8+ and PyPy3.

- **[Documentation]**

## What is new?

Please check the [ChangeLog] file for the detailed information.

DeepDiff 8-1-0

- Removing deprecated lines from setup.py
- Added `prefix` option to `pretty()`
- Fixes hashing of numpy boolean values.
- Fixes __slots__ comparison when the attribute doesn't exist.
- Relaxing orderly-set reqs
- Added Python 3.13 support
- Only lower if clean_key is instance of str #504
- Fixes issue where the key deep_distance is not returned when both
compared items are equal #510

- exclude_paths fails to work #509
- Fixes to_json() method chokes on standard json.dumps() kwargs such as
sort_keys

- Fixes accessing the affected_root_keys property on the diff object
returned by DeepDiff fails when one of the dicts is empty
- Fixes accessing the affected_root_keys property on the diff object
returned by DeepDiff fails when one of the dicts is empty #508

DeepDiff 8-0-1

- Bugfix. Numpy should be optional.

DeepDiff 8-0-0

With the introduction of `threshold_to_diff_deeper`, the values returned
are different than in previous versions of DeepDiff. You can still get the
older values by setting `threshold_to_diff_deeper=0`. However to signify
that enough has changed in this release that the users need to update the
parameters passed to DeepDiff, we will be doing a major version update.

- `use_enum_value=True` makes it so when diffing enum, we use the enum's
value. It makes it so comparing an enum to a string or any other value is
not reported as a type change.
- `threshold_to_diff_deeper=float` is a number between 0 and 1. When
comparing dictionaries that have a small intersection of keys, we will
report the dictionary as a `new_value` instead of reporting individual keys
changed. If you set it to zero, you get the same results as DeepDiff 7.0.1
and earlier, which means this feature is disabled. The new default is 0.33
which means if less that one third of keys between dictionaries intersect,
report it as a new object.
- Deprecated `ordered-set` and switched to `orderly-set`. The `ordered-set`
package was not being maintained anymore and starting Python 3.6, there
were better options for sets that ordered. I forked one of the new
implementations, modified it, and published it as `orderly-set`.
- Added `use_log_scale:bool` and `log_scale_similarity_threshold:float`.
They can be used to ignore small changes in numbers by comparing their
differences in logarithmic space. This is different than ignoring the
difference based on significant digits.
- json serialization of reversed lists.
- Fix for iterable moved items when `iterable_compare_func` is used.
- Pandas and Polars support.

DeepDiff 7-0-1

- Fixes the translation between Difflib opcodes and Delta flat rows.

DeepDiff 7-0-0

- DeepDiff 7 comes with an improved delta object. [Delta to flat
dictionaries] have undergone a major change. We have also introduced [Delta
serialize to flat rows].
- Subtracting delta objects have dramatically improved at the cost of
holding more metadata about the original objects.
- When `verbose=2`, and the "path" of an item has changed in a report
between t1 and t2, we include it as `new_path`.
- `path(use_t2=True)` returns the correct path to t2 in any reported change
in the [`tree view`]
- Python 3.7 support is dropped and Python 3.12 is officially supported.

DeepDiff 6-7-1
