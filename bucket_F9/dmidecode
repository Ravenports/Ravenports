[FILE:939:descriptions/desc.single]
Dmidecode reports information about your system's hardware as described in 
your system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard. This information 
typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS 
version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying level of 
interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. It will often 
include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, 
ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, 
parallel, USB).

DMI data can be used to enable or disable specific portions of kernel code 
depending on the specific hardware. Thus, one use of dmidecode is for 
kernel developers to detect system "signatures" and add them to the kernel 
source code when needed.

Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly 
trusted. Dmidecode does not scan your hardware, it only reports what the 
BIOS told it to.
