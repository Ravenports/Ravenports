pip - The Python Package Installer
==================================

pip is the `package installer`_ for Python. You can use pip to install
packages from the `Python Package Index`_ and other indexes.

Please take a look at our documentation for how to install and use pip:

* `Installation`_
* `Usage`_

We release updates regularly, with a new version every 3 months. Find more
details in our documentation:

* `Release notes`_
* `Release process`_

In pip 20.3, we've `made a big improvement to the heart of pip`_; `learn
more`_. We want your input, so `sign up for our user experience research
studies`_ to help us do it right.

**Note**: pip 21.0, in January 2021, removed Python 2 support, per pip's
`Python 2 support policy`_. Please migrate to Python 3.

If you find bugs, need help, or want to talk to the developers, please use
our mailing lists or chat rooms:

* `Issue tracking`_
* `Discourse channel`_
* `User IRC`_

If you want to get involved head over to GitHub to get the source code,
look at our development documentation and feel free to jump on the
developer mailing lists and chat rooms:

* `GitHub page`_
* `Development documentation`_
* `Development IRC`_
