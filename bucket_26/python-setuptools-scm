## about

[setuptools-scm] extracts Python package versions from `git` or
`hg` metadata instead of declaring them as the version argument
or in an SCM managed file.

Additionally, [setuptools-scm] provides setuptools
with a list of files that are managed by the SCM <br/>
(i.e. it automatically adds **all of** the SCM-managed files to the
sdist).<br/>
Unwanted files must be excluded via `MANIFEST.in`.

## `pyproject.toml` usage

The preferred way to configure [setuptools-scm] is to author
settings in a `tool.setuptools_scm` section of `pyproject.toml`.

This feature requires setuptools 61 or later.
First, ensure that [setuptools-scm] is present during the project's
build step by specifying it as one of the build requirements.

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=64", "setuptools_scm>=8"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

That will be sufficient to require [setuptools-scm] for projects
that support [PEP 518] like [pip] and [build].

[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip
[build]: https://pypi.org/project/build
[PEP 518]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/

To enable version inference, you need to set the version
dynamically in the `project` section of `pyproject.toml`:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[project]
# version = "0.0.1"  # Remove any existing version parameter.
dynamic = ["version"]

[tool.setuptools_scm]
```

Additionally, a version file can be written by specifying:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.setuptools_scm]
version_file = "pkg/_version.py"
```

Where `pkg` is the name of your package.

If you need to confirm which version string is being generated or debug the
configuration,
you can install [setuptools-scm] directly in your working environment and
run:

```console
$ python -m setuptools_scm
# To explore other options, try:
$ python -m setuptools_scm --help
```

For further configuration see the [documentation].

## Interaction with Enterprise Distributions

Some enterprise distributions like RHEL7
ship rather old setuptools versions.

In those cases its typically possible to build by using an sdist against
`setuptools_scm<2.0`.
As those old setuptools versions lack sensible types for versions,
modern [setuptools-scm] is unable to support them sensibly.

It's strongly recommended to build a wheel artifact using modern Python and
setuptools,
then installing the artifact instead of trying to run against old
setuptools versions.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the [setuptools-scm] project's codebases, issue
trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the
[PSF Code of Conduct].
