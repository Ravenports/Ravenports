## about

[setuptools-scm] extracts Python package versions from `git` or `hg`
metadata
instead of declaring them as the version argument
or in a Source Code Managed (SCM) managed file.

Additionally [setuptools-scm] provides `setuptools` with a list of
files that are managed by the SCM
<br/>
(i.e. it automatically adds all the SCM-managed files to the sdist).
<br/>
Unwanted files must be excluded via `MANIFEST.in`
or [configuring Git archive][git-archive-docs].

> **⚠️ Important:** Installing setuptools-scm automatically enables a
file finder that includes **all SCM-tracked files** in your source
distributions. This can be surprising if you have development files tracked
in Git/Mercurial that you don't want in your package. Use `MANIFEST.in` to
exclude unwanted files. See the [documentation] for details.

## `pyproject.toml` usage

The preferred way to configure [setuptools-scm] is to author
settings in a `tool.setuptools_scm` section of `pyproject.toml`.

This feature requires setuptools 61 or later (recommended: >=80 for best
compatibility).
First, ensure that [setuptools-scm] is present during the project's
build step by specifying it as one of the build requirements.

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=80", "setuptools-scm>=8"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

That will be sufficient to require [setuptools-scm] for projects
that support [PEP 518] like [pip] and [build].

[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip
[build]: https://pypi.org/project/build
[PEP 518]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/

To enable version inference, you need to set the version
dynamically in the `project` section of `pyproject.toml`:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[project]
# version = "0.0.1"  # Remove any existing version parameter.
dynamic = ["version"]

[tool.setuptools_scm]
```

!!! note "Simplified Configuration"

    Starting with setuptools-scm 8.1+, if `setuptools_scm` (or
`setuptools-scm`) is
    present in your `build-system.requires`, the `[tool.setuptools_scm]`
section
    becomes optional! You can now enable setuptools-scm with just:

    ```toml title="pyproject.toml"
    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools>=80", "setuptools-scm>=8"]
    build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

    [project]
    dynamic = ["version"]
    ```

    The `[tool.setuptools_scm]` section is only needed if you want to
customize
    configuration options.

Additionally, a version file can be written by specifying:

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[tool.setuptools_scm]
version_file = "pkg/_version.py"
```

Where `pkg` is the name of your package.

If you need to confirm which version string is being generated or debug the
configuration,
you can install [setuptools-scm] directly in your working environment and
run:

```console
$ python -m setuptools_scm
# To explore other options, try:
$ python -m setuptools_scm --help
```
