[FILE:381:descriptions/desc.primary]
The paper library and accompanying files are intended to provide a simple
way for applications to take actions based on a system- or user-specified
paper size.

This release is quite minimal, its purpose being to provide really basic
functions (obtaining the system paper name and getting the height and
width of a given kind of paper) that applications can immediately
integrate.
