puremagic
=========

puremagic is a pure python module that will identify a file based off
it's magic numbers.

|CoverageStatus| |License| |PyPi|

It is designed to be minimalistic and inherently cross platform
compatible. It is also designed to be a stand in for python-magic, it
incorporates the functions from\_file(filename[, mime]) and
from\_string(string[, mime]) however the magic\_file() and
magic\_string() are more powerful and will also display confidence and
duplicate matches.

It does NOT try to match files off non-magic string. In other words it
will not search for a string within a certain window of bytes like
others might.

Advantages over using a wrapper for 'file' or 'libmagic':

-  Faster
-  Lightweight
-  Cross platform compatible
-  No dependencies

Disadvantages:

-  Does not have as many file types
-  No multilingual comments
-  Duplications due to small or reused magic numbers

(Help fix the first two disadvantages by contributing!)

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Python 3.8+

Using github ci to run continuous integration tests on listed platforms.
