jsonlite: A Robust, High Performance JSON Parser and Generator for R

A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the
web. Started out as a fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely rewritten
in recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust, high performance
tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building
pipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is based on
the mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to
converting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to
stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with the
package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently for
use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
