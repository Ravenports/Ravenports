jsonlite: A Simple and Robust JSON Parser and Generator for R

A reasonably fast JSON parser and generator, optimized for statistical data
and the web. Offers simple, flexible tools for working with JSON in R, and
is particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting with a web
API. The implementation is based on the mapping described in the vignette
(Ooms, 2014). In addition to converting JSON data from/to R objects,
'jsonlite' contains functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data.
The unit tests included with the package verify that all edge cases are
encoded and decoded consistently for use with dynamic data in systems and
applications.
