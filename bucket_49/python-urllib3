urllib3 is a powerful, *user-friendly* HTTP client for Python. Much of the
Python ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.
urllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python
standard libraries:

- Thread safety.
- Connection pooling.
- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
- File uploads with multipart encoding.
- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.
- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.
- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.
- 100% test coverage.

urllib3 is powerful and easy to use:

```python3
>>> import urllib3
>>> resp = urllib3.request("GET", "http://httpbin.org/robots.txt")
>>> resp.status
200
>>> resp.data
b"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /deny\n"
```

## Installing

urllib3 can be installed with [pip]:

```bash
$ python -m pip install urllib3
```

Alternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub]:
