# NetBox Inventory Plugin

A [Netbox] plugin for hardware inventory.

## Features

Keep track of your hardware, whether it is installed or in storage. You can
define assets that represent hardware that can be used as a device, module
or
inventory item in NetBox.

Each asset can have a storage location defined, when not in use. You can
assign
an asset to a device, module or inventory item. The plugin can keep serial
number
and asset tag between asset and device, module or inventory item in sync if
enabled in settings.

On Site and Location detail views there is a new tab Assets that can show
assets
that are stored or installed at that location or both. Rack details view
also has
a tab for installed Assets. This provides a unified view of all assets at a
given
location.

To properly support inventory items (that are used in NetBox to model SFP
and
similar modules) the plugin defines inventory item types that are
equivalent to
device types and module types. 

Inventory item types can be assigned into inventory item groups. On a group
detail
view you have an overview of the number of contained assets broken down by
asset
status or inventory item type and status. This way you can quickly see how
many
of a certain type of hardware you still have spare.

Inventory item groups can be nested, so you can for example model all
pluggables
as one top-level group with child groups for SFP+ modules, SFP28 modules
and so
on.

### Automatic management of asset status

Each asset has a status attribute that can indicate use of the asset. These
statuses can be set as needed by each NetBox installation.

Two statuses can have a special meaning. One to indicate asset is in
storage and one
to indicate asset is in use.

netbox_inventory can automatically set status to the value specified in
`used_status_name` configuration item when an asset is assigned to a
device, module
or inventory item.

When you remove an asset from device, module or inventory item the plugin
will set
asset status to `stored_status_name` configuration item.

To disable automatically changing status, set these two config parameters
to `None`.

### Prevent unwanted changes for tagged assets

With `asset_disable_editing_fields_for_tags` and
`asset_disable_deletion_for_tags` you can prevent changes to specified
asset data for assets that have certain tags attached. Changes are only
prevented via web interface. API modifications are allowed.

The idea is that an external system uses some assets stored in
netbox_inventory, and you want to prevent accidental changes to data
directly in NetBox web interface. Only that external system should modify
the data.

## Compatibility

This plugin requires netbox version 3.5.x to work. Older versions of the
plugin
support older netbox version as per table below:

| NetBox Version | Plugin Version |
|----------------|----------------|
|       3.3      |      1.1.x     |
|       3.4      |      1.2.x     |
|       3.5      | 1.3.x & 1.4.x  |
|       3.6      |      1.5.x     |

## Installing

Review [official Netbox plugin documentation] for installation
instructions.

You install the plugin from pypi with pip. Make sure you activate Netbox's
virtual
environment first:
