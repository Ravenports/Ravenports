PyNaCl: Python binding to the libsodium library
===============================================

    :alt: Latest Version

    :alt: Compatible Python Versions

PyNaCl is a Python binding to `libsodium`_, which is a fork of the
`Networking and Cryptography library`_. These libraries have a stated goal
of
improving usability, security and speed. It supports Python 2.7 and 3.5+ as
well as PyPy 2.6+.

.. _Networking and Cryptography library: https://nacl.cr.yp.to/

Features
--------

* Digital signatures
* Secret-key encryption
* Public-key encryption
* Hashing and message authentication
* Password based key derivation and password hashing

Installation
============

Binary wheel install
--------------------

PyNaCl ships as a binary wheel on macOS, Windows and Linux manylinux1
[#many]_ ,
so all dependencies are included. Make sure you have an up-to-date pip
and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pynacl

Linux source build
------------------

PyNaCl relies on `libsodium`_, a portable C library. A copy is bundled
with PyNaCl so to install you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pynacl

If you'd prefer to use the version of libsodium provided by your
distribution, you can disable the bundled copy during install by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ SODIUM_INSTALL=system pip install pynacl

.. warning:: Usage of the legacy easy_install command provided by
setuptools
   is generally discouraged, and is completely unsupported in PyNaCl's
case.

.. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium

.. [#many] [manylinux1 wheels]
    are built on a baseline linux environment based on Centos 5.11
    and should work on most x86 and x86_64 glibc based linux environments.

Changelog
=========

1.4.0 (2020-05-25)
------------------

* Update libsodium to 1.0.18.
* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** We no longer distribute 32-bit manylinux1
  wheels. Continuing to produce them was a maintenance burden.
* Added support for Python 3.8, and removed support for Python 3.4.
* Add low level bindings for extracting the seed and the public key
  from crypto_sign_ed25519 secret key
* Add low level bindings for deterministic random generation.
* Add wheel and setuptools setup_requirements in ``setup.py`` (#485)
* Fix checks on very slow builders (#481, #495)
* Add low-level bindings to ed25519 arithmetic functions
* Update low-level blake2b state implementation
* Fix wrong short-input behavior of SealedBox.decrypt() (#517)
* Raise CryptPrefixError exception instead of InvalidkeyError when trying
  to check a password against a verifier stored in a unknown format (#519)
* Add support for minimal builds of libsodium. Trying to call functions
  not available in a minimal build will raise an UnavailableError
  exception. To compile a minimal build of the bundled libsodium, set
  the SODIUM_INSTALL_MINIMAL environment variable to any non-empty
  string (e.g. ``SODIUM_INSTALL_MINIMAL=1``) for setup.
