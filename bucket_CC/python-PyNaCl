===============================================
PyNaCl: Python binding to the libsodium library
===============================================

    :alt: Latest Version

PyNaCl is a Python binding to `libsodium`_, which is a fork of the
`Networking and Cryptography library`_. These libraries have a stated goal
of
improving usability, security and speed. It supports Python 3.8+ as well as
PyPy 3.

.. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
.. _Networking and Cryptography library: https://nacl.cr.yp.to/

Features
--------

* Digital signatures
* Secret-key encryption
* Public-key encryption
* Hashing and message authentication
* Password based key derivation and password hashing

Installation
============

Binary wheel install
--------------------

PyNaCl ships as a binary wheel on macOS, Windows and Linux manylinux1
[#many]_ ,
so all dependencies are included. Make sure you have an up-to-date pip
and run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pynacl

Faster wheel build
------------------

You can define the environment variable LIBSODIUM_MAKE_ARGS to pass
arguments to make
and enable `parallelization`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ LIBSODIUM_MAKE_ARGS=-j4 pip install pynacl

Linux source build
------------------

PyNaCl relies on `libsodium`_, a portable C library. A copy is bundled
with PyNaCl so to install you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pynacl

If you'd prefer to use the version of libsodium provided by your
distribution, you can disable the bundled copy during install by running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ SODIUM_INSTALL=system pip install pynacl

.. warning:: Usage of the legacy easy_install command provided by
setuptools
   is generally discouraged, and is completely unsupported in PyNaCl's
case.

.. _parallelization:
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Parallel.html

.. _libsodium: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium

.. [#many] [manylinux1 wheels]
    are built on a baseline linux environment based on Centos 5.11
    and should work on most x86 and x86_64 glibc based linux environments.
