RcppArmadillo: 'Rcpp' Integration for the 'Armadillo' Templated Linear
AlgebraLibrary

'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad Sanderson)
that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries. The
'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header files from the templated
'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not need to install 'Armadillo' itself
in order to use 'RcppArmadillo'. From release 7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is
licensed under Apache License 2; previous releases were under licensed as
MPL 2.0 from version 3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3 prior to that;
'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under
the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'.
