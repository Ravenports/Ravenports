ruamel.yaml
===========

``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version:       0.16.13
:updated:       2021-03-05
:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io
:repository:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruamel-yaml/
:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/

*The 0.16.13 release is the last that will tested to be working on Python
2.7.
The 0.17 series will still be tested on Python 3.5, but the 0.18 will not.
The
0.17 series will also stop support for the old PyYAML functions, so a
`YAML()` instance
will need to be created.*

*Please adjust your dependencies accordingly if necessary.*

Starting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped
is changing. See the API doc for details.  Currently existing
functionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.
**For production systems you should pin the version being used with
``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``**. There might be bug fixes in the 0.14 series,
but new functionality is likely only to be available via the new API.

If your package uses ``ruamel.yaml`` and is not listed on PyPI, drop
me an email, preferably with some information on how you use the
package (or a link to bitbucket/github) and I'll keep you informed
when the status of the API is stable enough to make the transition.
