ruamel.yaml
===========

``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version:       0.17.24
:updated:       2023-05-06
:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io
:repository:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruamel-yaml/
:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/

*Starting with 0.17.22 only Python 3.7+ is supported.
The 0.17 series is also the last to support old PyYAML functions, replace
it by 
creating a `YAML()` instance and use its `.load()` and `.dump()` methods.*
New(er) functionality is usually only available via the new API.

The 0.17.21 was the last one tested to be working on Python 3.5 and 3.6
(the
latter was not tested, because 
tox/virtualenv stopped supporting that EOL version).
The 0.16.13 release was the last that was tested to be working on Python
2.7.

*Please adjust/pin your dependencies accordingly if necessary.
(`ruamel.yaml<0.18`)*

There are now two extra plug-in packages (`ruamel.yaml.bytes` and
`ruamel.yaml.string`)
for those not wanting to do the streaming to a `io.BytesIO/StringIO` buffer
themselves.

If your package uses ``ruamel.yaml`` and is not listed on PyPI, drop
me an email, preferably with some information on how you use the
package (or a link to the repository) and I'll keep you informed
when the status of the API is stable enough to make the transition.

ChangeLog
=========

.. should insert NEXT: at the beginning of line for next key (with empty
line)

0.17.24 (2023-05-06):
  - rewrite of ``CommentedMap.insert()``. If you have a merge key in
    the YAML document for the mapping you insert to, the position value
should 
    be the one as you look at the YAML input.
    This fixes issue 453 where other
    keys of a merged in mapping would show up after an insert (reported by
    [Alex Miller]). It
    also fixes a call to `.insert()` resulting into the merge key to move
    to be the first key if it wasn't already and it is also now possible
    to insert a key before a merge key (even if the fist key in the
mapping).
  - fix (in the pure Python implementation including default) for issue
447.
    (reported by [Jack Cherng], 
    also brought up by brent on 
    [StackOverflow])

0.17.23 (2023-05-05):
  - fix 458, error on plain scalars starting with word longer than width.
    (reported by [Kyle Larose])
  - fix for ``.update()`` no longer correctly handling keyword arguments
    (reported by John Lin on <StackOverflow 
    `<https://stackoverflow.com/q/76089100/1307905>`__)
  - fix issue 454: high Unicode (emojis) in quoted strings always
    escaped (reported by `Michal Čihař
<https://sourceforge.net/u/nijel/profile/>`__
    based on a question on StackOverflow).
  - fix issue with emitter conservatively inserting extra backslashes in
wrapped
    quoted strings (reported by thebenman on [StackOverflow 
   ])

0.17.22 (2023-05-02):

  - fix issue 449 where the second exclamation marks got URL encoded
(reported
    and fixing PR provided by [John Stark])
  - fix issue with indent != 2 and literal scalars with empty first line
    (reported by wrdis on [StackOverflow])
  - updated __repr__ of CommentedMap, now that Python's dict is ordered ->
no more 
    ordereddict(list-of-tuples)
  - merge MR 4, handling OctalInt in YAML 1.1 
    (provided by [Jacob Floyd])
  - fix loading of `!!float 42` (reported by Eric on
    [Stack overflow])
  - line numbers are now set on `CommentedKeySeq` and `CommentedKeyMap`
