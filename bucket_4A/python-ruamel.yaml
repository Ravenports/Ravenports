ruamel.yaml
===========

``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version:       0.17.21
:updated:       2022-02-12
:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io
:repository:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruamel-yaml/
:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/

*The 0.16.13 release was the last that was tested to be working on Python
2.7.
The 0.17.21 is the last one tested to be working on Python 3.5, 
that is also the last release supporting old PyYAML functions, you'll have
to create a 
`YAML()` instance and use its `.load()` and `.dump()` methods.*

*Please adjust your dependencies accordingly if necessary.
(`ruamel.yaml<0.18`)*

Starting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped
has been changing, see the API doc for details.  Currently existing
functionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.
**For production systems already using a pre 0.16 version, you should
pin the version being used with ``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``** if you cannot
fully test upgrading to a newer version. For new usage
pin to the minor version tested ( ``ruamel.yaml<=0.17``) or even to the
exact version used. 

New functionality is usually only available via the new API, so
make sure you use it and stop using the `ruamel.yaml.safe_load()`,
`ruamel.yaml.round_trip_load()` and `ruamel.yaml.load()` functions
(and their `
