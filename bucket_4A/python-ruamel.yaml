ruamel.yaml
===========

``ruamel.yaml`` is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version:       0.17.11
:updated:       2021-08-19
:documentation: http://yaml.readthedocs.io
:repository:    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ruamel-yaml/
:pypi:          https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/

*The 0.16.13 release was the last that will tested to be working on Python
2.7.
The 0.17 series will still be tested on Python 3.5, but the 0.18 will not.
The
0.17 series will also stop support for the old PyYAML functions, so a
`YAML()` instance
will need to be created.*

*The 0.17 series will also see changes in how comments are attached during
roundtrip. This will result in backwards incompatibilities on the `.ca`
data and
it might even be necessary for documented methods that handle comments.*

*Please adjust your dependencies accordingly if necessary.
(`ruamel.yaml<0.17`)*

Starting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped
has been changing, see the API doc for details.  Currently existing
functionality will throw a warning before being changed/removed.
**For production systems already using a pre 0.16 version, you should
pin the version being used with ``ruamel.yaml<=0.15``** if you cannot
fully test upgrading to a newer version. For new usage
pin to the minor version tested ( ``ruamel.yaml<=0.17``) or even to the
exact version used. 

New functionality is usually only available via the new API, so
make sure you use it and stop using the `ruamel.yaml.safe_load()`,
`ruamel.yaml.round_trip_load()` and `ruamel.yaml.load()` functions
(and their `
