Sakura is a terminal emulator based on the GTK+ toolkit and VTE. It 
provides basic features and options and supports tabs. Sakura can also be 
customized to some degree using a configuration file, but generally tries 
to keep things simple. As a result it only needs very few dependencies to 
work.
