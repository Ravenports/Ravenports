Description
===========

Makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal text
and
cursor positioning) work under MS Windows.

ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored
terminal
text and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on
Windows, too, by wrapping stdout, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which
would appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the
appropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other
platforms,
Colorama does nothing.

Colorama also provides some shortcuts to help generate ANSI sequences
but works fine in conjunction with any other ANSI sequence generation
library,
such as the venerable Termcolor (https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/)
or the fabulous Blessings (https://pypi.org/project/blessings/).

This has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing
colored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that
existing
applications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored
output on
Linux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling
``colorama.init()``.

An alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows machines,
which
provides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals.
Colorama
is intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g., maybe your app
doesn't
have an installer.)

Demo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using
ANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's built in ANSI
handling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:
