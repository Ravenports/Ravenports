Incremental
===========

Incremental is a small library that versions your Python projects.

API documentation can be found [here].

Quick Start
-----------

Add this to your ``setup.py``\ 's ``setup()`` call, removing any other
versioning arguments:

.. code::

   setup(
       use_incremental=True,
       setup_requires=['incremental'],
       install_requires=['incremental'], # along with any other install
dependencies
       ...
   }

Install Incremental to your local environment with ``pip install
incremental[scripts]``.
Then run ``python -m incremental.update <projectname> --create``.
It will create a file in your package named ``_version.py`` and look like
this:

.. code::

   from incremental import Version

   __version__ = Version("widgetbox", 17, 1, 0)
   __all__ = ["__version__"]

Then, so users of your project can find your version, in your root
package's ``__init__.py`` add:

.. code::

   from ._version import __version__

Subsequent installations of your project will then use Incremental for
versioning.

Incremental Versions
--------------------

``incremental.Version`` is a class that represents a version of a given
project.
It is made up of the following elements (which are given during
instantiation):

- package (required), the name of the package this Version represents.
- major, minor, micro (all required), the X.Y.Z of your project's Version.
- release_candidate (optional), set to 0 or higher to mark this Version
being of a release candidate (also sometimes called a "prerelease").
- post (optional), set to 0 or higher to mark this Version as a
postrelease.
- dev (optional), set to 0 or higher to mark this Version as a development
release.

You can extract a PEP-440 compatible version string by using the
``.public()`` method, which returns a str containing the full version. This
is the version you should provide to users, or publicly use. An example
output would be ``"13.2.0"``, ``"17.1.2dev1"``, or ``"18.8.0rc2"``.

Calling ``repr() with a Version`` will give a Python-source-code
representation of it, and calling ``str() with a Version will provide a
string similar to '[Incremental, version 16.10.1]'``.

Updating
--------

Incremental includes a tool to automate updating your Incremental-using
project's version called ``incremental.update``.
It updates the ``_version.py`` file and automatically updates some uses of
Incremental versions from an indeterminate version to the current one.
It requires click from PyPI.

``python -m incremental.update <projectname>`` will perform updates on that
package.
The commands that can be given after that will determine what the next
version is.

- ``--newversion=<version>``, to set the project version to a
fully-specified version (like 1.2.3, or 17.1.0dev1).
- ``--rc``, to set the project version to ``<year-2000>.<month>.0rc1`` if
the current version is not a release candidate, or bump the release
candidate number by 1 if it is.
- ``--dev``, to set the project development release number to 0 if it is
not a development release, or bump the development release number by 1 if
it is.
- ``--patch``, to increment the patch number of the release. This will also
reset the release candidate number, pass ``--rc`` at the same time to
