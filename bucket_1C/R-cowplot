cowplot: Streamlined Plot Theme and Plot Annotations for 'ggplot2'

Provides various features that help with creating publication-quality
figures with 'ggplot2', such as a set of themes, functions to align plots
and arrange them into complex compound figures, and functions that make it
easy to annotate plots and or mix plots with images. The package was
originally written for internal use in the Wilke lab, hence the name (Claus
O. Wilke's plot package). It has also been used extensively in the book
Fundamentals of Data Visualization.
