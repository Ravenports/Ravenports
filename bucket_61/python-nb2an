# nb2an: Netbox to Ansible

[NetBox] and
[Ansible] both require a lot of manual
configuration, often with duplicate information. Keeping them in sync
can be a daunting challenge. The **nb2an** package provides utilities to
map NetBox values to ansible *host_vars* using a simple mapping file.

Read the [full documentation online]

# Installation

You can use *pip* or *pipx* to install the nb2an tools:

    pipx install nb2an

# Usage

Updating your ansible data from netbox requires the following steps.

## Step 1: Create a nb2an configuration file

*nb2an* tools take a YAML-based master configuration file containing
your netbox API token (which you'll need to get from your NetBox
instance). In this configuration file you can set a number of variables.
Note that some of these can be overridden with command line options.

``` yaml
# Your netbox API token:
token: YOUR_NETBOX_API_TOKEN

# what the API path is for your netbox install
api_url: https://netbox/api/

# domain suffix of your ansible FQDNs
# (nb2an tools will check NetBox for simple and full names)
suffix: .example.com

# where th eroot of your ansible code is stored
ansible_directory: /home/user/ansible
```

## Step 2: create a YAML mapping file

The *nb-update-ansible* tool is designed to only update variables within
your ansible host_vars that you ask it to, leaving everything else
(including comments) the same. Note that formatting is overwritten by
default, but see below for how to make a patch instead (actually TBD).

The YAML file consists of a host_vars YAML structure that you'd like to
have updated. Currently this supports only dictionaries, but array
support is coming shortly. The value of each variable should be a dotted
notation of where to pull the information from in the netbox data for a
given device. See the *nb-device* tool below for how to get a dump of a
device for easier reading.

Here's an example mapping file, that updates or creates information in a
*host_info* section and a *netbox_info* section.

``` yaml
host_info:
    serial_number: serial
    site: site.name
    location: location.name
    rack: rack.display
    position: position
netbox_info:
    id: id
    site_url: site.url
```

## Step 3: Run *nb-update-ansible*

**Note:** don't forget to check in to your VC (*git*) any outstanding
changes you have to your files in *host_vars* before running this tool.

    $ np-update-ansible -c sample.yml
    INFO      : modifying
/home/user/ansible/host_vars/firewall.example.com.yml

    $ cd /home/user/ansible/host_vars

    $ git diff
    diff --git a/host_vars/f1-lab.example.com.yml
b/host_vars/f1-lab.example.com.yml
    --- a/host_vars/f1-lab.example.com.yml
    +++ b/host_vars/f1-lab.example.com.yml
    +host_info:
    +  serial_number: 00112233
    +  site: MIA
    +  location: DC9 Room Q
    +  rack: Rack1
    +  position: 40
    +netbox_info:
    +  id: 37
    +  device_url: https://netbox/api/device/37/
    +  site_url: https://netbox/api/dcim/sites/7/

Profit!
