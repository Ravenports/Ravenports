[FILE:494:descriptions/desc.single]
Pwgen is a small, GPL'ed password generator which creates passwords which
can be easily memorized by a human.

This version of was written by Theodore Ts'o.  It is modelled after a
program originally written by Brandon S. Allbery, and then later
extensively modified by Olaf Titz,  Jim Lynch, and others.  It was
rewritten from scratch by Theodore Ts'o because the original program was
somewhat of a hack, and thus hard to maintain, and because the licensing
status of the program was unclear.
