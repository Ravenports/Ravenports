Mpc is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with
arbitrarily high precision and correct rounding of the result.
It is built upon and follows the same principles as Mpfr. The
library is written by Andreas Enge, Philippe Theveny and Paul
Zimmermann and is distributed under the Gnu Lesser General Public
License, either version 2.1 of the license, or (at your option)
