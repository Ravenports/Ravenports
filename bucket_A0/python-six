Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.  It provides utility
functions
for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the
goal of
writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions.  See the
documentation for more information on what is provided.

Six supports Python 2.7 and 3.3+.  It is contained in only one Python
file, so it can be easily copied into your project. (The copyright and
license
notice must be retained.)

Online documentation is at https://six.readthedocs.io/.

Bugs can be reported to https://github.com/benjaminp/six.  The code can
also
be found there.
