``pyproject-hooks``
===================

This is a low-level library for calling build-backends in
``pyproject.toml``-based project. It provides the basic functionality to
help write tooling that generates distribution files from Python projects.

If you want a tool that builds Python packages, you'll want to use
https://github.com/pypa/build instead. This is an underlying piece for
`pip`, `build` and other "build frontends" use to call "build backends"
within them.

You can read more in the [documentation].

  Note: The pep517 project has been replaced by this project (low level)
and the build project (high level).
