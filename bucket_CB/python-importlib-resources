importlib_resources is a backport of Python standard library
`importlib.resources
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources>`_
module for older Pythons.

The key goal of this module is to replace parts of [pkg_resources
] with a
solution in Python's stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs.  This makes
reading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and
consistent
semantics.

Compatibility

New features are introduced in this third-party library and later merged
into CPython. The following table indicates which versions of this library
