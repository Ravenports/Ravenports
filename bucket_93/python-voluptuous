# CONTRIBUTIONS ONLY

**What does this mean?** I do not have time to fix issues myself. The only
way fixes or new features will be added is by people submitting PRs.

**Current status:** Voluptuous is largely feature stable. There hasn't been
a need to add new features in a while, but there are some bugs that should
be fixed.

**Why?** I no longer use Voluptuous personally (in fact I no longer
regularly write Python code). Rather than leave the project in a limbo of
people filing issues and wondering why they're not being worked on, I
believe this notice will more clearly set expectations.

# Voluptuous is a Python data validation library

Voluptuous, *despite* the name, is a Python data validation library. It
is primarily intended for validating data coming into Python as JSON,
YAML, etc.

It has three goals:

1. Simplicity.
2. Support for complex data structures.
3. Provide useful error messages.

## Contact

Voluptuous now has a mailing list! Send a mail to
[<voluptuous@librelist.com>] to subscribe. Instructions
will follow.

You can also contact me directly via [email] or
[Twitter].

To file a bug, create a [new issue] on GitHub with a short example of how
to replicate the issue.

## Documentation

The documentation is provided [here].

## Contribution to Documentation

Documentation is built using `Sphinx`. You can install it by

    pip install -r requirements.txt

For building `sphinx-apidoc` from scratch you need to set PYTHONPATH to
`voluptuous/voluptuous` repository.

The documentation is provided [here.]

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md].

## Why use Voluptuous over another validation library?

**Validators are simple callables:**
No need to subclass anything, just use a function.

**Errors are simple exceptions:**
A validator can just `raise Invalid(msg)` and expect the user to get
useful messages.

**Schemas are basic Python data structures:**
Should your data be a dictionary of integer keys to strings?
`{int: str}` does what you expect. List of integers, floats or
strings? `[int, float, str]`.

**Designed from the ground up for validating more than just forms:**
Nested data structures are treated in the same way as any other
type. Need a list of dictionaries? `[{}]`

**Consistency:**
Types in the schema are checked as types. Values are compared as
values. Callables are called to validate. Simple.

## Show me an example

Twitter's [user search API] accepts
query URLs like:

```bash
$ curl
'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/search.json?q=python&per_page=20&page=1'
```

To validate this we might use a schema like:

```pycon
