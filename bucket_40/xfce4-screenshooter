The Xfce screenthooter allows you to capture the entire screen, the active 
window or a selected region. You can set the delay that elapses before the 
screenshot is taken and the action that will be done with the screenshot: 
save it to a PNG file, copy it to the clipboard, open it using another 
application, or host it on ZimageZ, a free online image hosting service.

A plugin for the Xfce panel is also available.
