[FILE:453:descriptions/desc.static]
This is Expat, a C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark.
Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser.  This means that you register
handlers with the parser before starting the parse.  These handlers
are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the
document being parsed.  A start tag is an example of the kind of
structures for which you may register handlers.

This package contains the static library, header, and man page.
