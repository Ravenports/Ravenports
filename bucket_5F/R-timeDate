timeDate: Rmetrics - Chronological and Calendar Objects

The 'timeDate' class fulfils the conventions of the ISO 8601 standard as
well as of the ANSI C and POSIX standards. Beyond these standards it
provides the "Financial Center" concept which allows to handle data records
collected in different time zones and mix them up to have always the proper
time stamps with respect to your personal financial center, or
alternatively to the GMT reference time. It can thus also handle time
stamps from historical data records from the same time zone, even if the
financial centers changed day light saving times at different calendar
dates.
