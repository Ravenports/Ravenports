collapse: Advanced and Fast Data Transformation

A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and statistical
computing in R that is extremely fast, class-agnostic, and programmer
friendly through a flexible and robust API. Core functionality includes a
rich set of S3 generic grouped and weighted statistical functions for
vectors, matrices and data frames, which provide efficient low-level
vectorizations, OpenMP multithreading, and skip missing values by default.
These are integrated with fast grouping and ordering algorithms (also
callable from C), and efficient data manipulation functions. The package
also provides a flexible and rigorous approach to time series and panel
data in R. It further includes fast functions for common statistical
procedures, detailed (grouped, weighted) summary statistics, powerful tools
to work with nested data, fast data object conversions, functions for
memory efficient R programming, and helpers to effectively deal with
variable labels, attributes, and missing data. It is well integrated with
basic R, 'dplyr'/'tibble', 'data.table', 'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data
frames), and accommodates, by virtue of smart internal attribute handling,
many other classes (like 'ts', 'xts'/'zoo' or 'tsibble').
