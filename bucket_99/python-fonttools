What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.7
or later.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.37.4 (released 2022-09-30)
----------------------------

4.37.4 (released 2022-09-30)
----------------------------

- [subset] Keep nameIDs used by CPAL palette entry labels (#2837).
- [varLib] Avoid negative hmtx values when creating font from variable CFF2
font (#2827).
- [instancer] Don't prune stat.ElidedFallbackNameID (#2828).
- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/Blocks to Unicode 15.0 (#2833).

4.37.3 (released 2022-09-20)
----------------------------

- Fix arguments in calls to (glyf) glyph.draw() and drawPoints(), whereby
offset wasn't
  correctly passed down; this fix also exposed a second bug, where lsb and
tsb were not
  set (#2824, #2825, adobe-type-tools/afdko#1560).

4.37.2 (released 2022-09-15)
----------------------------

- [subset] Keep CPAL table and don't attempt to prune unused color indices
if OT-SVG
  table is present even if COLR table was subsetted away; OT-SVG may be
referencing the
  CPAL table; for now we assume that's the case (#2814, #2815).
- [varLib.instancer] Downgrade GPOS/GSUB version if there are no more
FeatureVariations
  after instancing (#2812).
- [subset] Added ``--no-lazy`` to optionally load fonts eagerly (mostly to
ease
  debugging of table lazy loading, no practical effects) (#2807).
- [varLib] Avoid building empty COLR.DeltaSetIndexMap with only identity
mappings (#2803).
- [feaLib] Allow multiple value record types (by promoting to the most
general format)
  within the same PairPos subtable; e.g. this allows variable and non
variable kerning
  rules to share the same subtable. This also fixes a bug whereby some
kerning pairs
  would become unreachable while shapiong because of premature subtable
splitting (#2772, #2776).
- [feaLib] Speed up VarScalar by caching models for recurring master
locations (#2798).
- [feaLib] Optionally cythonize ``feaLib.lexer``, speeds up parsing FEA a
bit (#2799).
- [designspaceLib] Avoid crash when handling unbounded rule conditions
(#2797).
- [post] Don't crash if post legacy format 1 is malformed/improperly used
(#2786)
- [gvar] Don't be "lazy" (load all glyph variations up front) when
TTFont.lazy=False (#2771).
- [TTFont] Added normalizeLocation method to normalize a location dict from
the
  font's defined axes space (also known as "user space") into the
normalized (-1..+1)
  space. It applies avar mapping if the font contains an avar table
(#2789).
- [TTVarGlyphSet] Support drawing glyph instances from CFF2 variable glyph
set (#2784).
- [fontBuilder] Do not error when building cmap if there are zero code
points (#2785).
- [varLib.plot] Added ability to plot a variation model and set of
accompaning master
  values corresponding to the model's master locations into a pyplot figure
(#2767).
- [Snippets] Added ``statShape.py`` script to draw statistical shape of a
glyph as an
