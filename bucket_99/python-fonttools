What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.7
or later.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.28.5 (released 2021-12-19)
----------------------------

- [svgPathPen] Continuation of #2471: make sure all occurrences of
``str()`` are now
  replaced with user-defined ntos callable.
- [merge] Refactored code into submodules, plus several bugfixes and
improvements:
  fixed duplicate-glyph-resolution GSUB-lookup generation code; use
tolerance in glyph
  comparison for empty glyph's width; ignore space of default ignorable
glyphs;
  downgrade duplicates-resolution missing-GSUB from assert to warn; added
--drop-tables
  option (#2473, #2475, #2476).

4.28.4 (released 2021-12-15)
----------------------------

- [merge] Merge GDEF marksets in Lookups properly (#2474).
- [feaLib] Have fontTools feaLib script exit with error code when build
fails (#2459)
- [svgPathPen] Added ntos option to customize number formatting (e.g.
rounding) (#2471).
- [subset] Speed up subsetting of large CFF fonts (#2467).
- [otTables] Speculatively promote lookups to extension to speed up
compilation. If the
  offset to lookup N is too big to fit in a ushort, the offset to lookup
N+1 is going to
  be too big as well, so we promote to extension all lookups from lookup N
onwards (#2465).

4.28.3 (released 2021-12-03)
----------------------------

- [subset] Fixed bug while subsetting COLR table, whereby incomplete layer
records
  pointing to missing glyphs were being retained leading to
``struct.error`` upon
  compiling. Make it so that glyf glyph closure, which follows the COLR
glyph
  closure, does not influence the COLR table subsetting (#2461, #2462).
- [docs] Fully document the cmap and glyf tables (#2454, #2457).
- [colorLib.unbuilder] Fixed CLI by deleting no longer existing parameter
(180bb1867).

4.28.2 (released 2021-11-22)
----------------------------

- [otlLib] Remove duplicates when building coverage (#2433).
- [docs] Add interrogate configuration (#2443).
- [docs] Remove comment about missing “start” optional argument to
calcChecksum (#2448).
- [cu2qu/cli] Adapt to the latest ufoLib2.
- [subset] Support subsetting SVG table and remove it from the list of 
drop by default tables (#534).
- [subset] add ``--pretty-svg`` option to pretty print SVG table contents
(#2452).
- [merge] Support merging CFF tables (CID-keyed CFF is still not supported)
(#2447).
- [merge] Support ``--output-file`` (#2447).
- [docs] Split table docs into individual pages (#2444).
- [feaLib] Forbid empty classes (#2446).
- [docs] Improve documentation for ``fontTools.ttLib.ttFont`` (#2442).

4.28.1 (released 2021-11-08)
----------------------------

- [subset] Fixed AttributeError while traversing a color glyph's Paint
graph when there is no
  LayerList, which is optional (#2441).
