What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.8
or later. We try to follow the same schedule of minimum Python version
support as
NumPy (see [NEP 29]).

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:
