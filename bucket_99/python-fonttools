What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.7
or later.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.28.3 (released 2021-12-03)
----------------------------

- [subset] Fixed bug while subsetting COLR table, whereby incomplete layer
records
  pointing to missing glyphs were being retained leading to
``struct.error`` upon
  compiling. Make it so that glyf glyph closure, which follows the COLR
glyph
  closure, does not influence the COLR table subsetting (#2461, #2462).
- [docs] Fully document the cmap and glyf tables (#2454, #2457).
- [colorLib.unbuilder] Fixed CLI by deleting no longer existing parameter
(180bb1867).

4.28.2 (released 2021-11-22)
----------------------------

- [otlLib] Remove duplicates when building coverage (#2433).
- [docs] Add interrogate configuration (#2443).
- [docs] Remove comment about missing “start” optional argument to
calcChecksum (#2448).
- [cu2qu/cli] Adapt to the latest ufoLib2.
- [subset] Support subsetting SVG table and remove it from the list of 
drop by default tables (#534).
- [subset] add ``--pretty-svg`` option to pretty print SVG table contents
(#2452).
- [merge] Support merging CFF tables (CID-keyed CFF is still not supported)
(#2447).
- [merge] Support ``--output-file`` (#2447).
- [docs] Split table docs into individual pages (#2444).
- [feaLib] Forbid empty classes (#2446).
- [docs] Improve documentation for ``fontTools.ttLib.ttFont`` (#2442).

4.28.1 (released 2021-11-08)
----------------------------

- [subset] Fixed AttributeError while traversing a color glyph's Paint
graph when there is no
  LayerList, which is optional (#2441).

4.28.0 (released 2021-11-05)
----------------------------

- Dropped support for EOL Python 3.6, require Python 3.7 (#2417).
- [ufoLib/glifLib] Make filename-clash checks faster by using a set instead
of a list (#2422).
- [subset] Don't crash if optional ClipList and LayerList are None (empty)
(#2424, 2439).
- [OT-SVG] Removed support for old deprecated version 1 and embedded color
palettes,
  which were never officially part of the OpenType SVG spec. Upon compile,
reuse offsets
  to SVG documents that are identical (#2430).
- [feaLib] Added support for Variable Feature File syntax. This is
experimental and subject
  to change until it is finalized in the Adobe FEA spec (#2432).
- [unicodedata] Update Scripts/ScriptExtensions/Blocks to UnicodeData 14.0
(#2437).

4.27.1 (released 2021-09-23)
----------------------------

- [otlLib] Fixed error when chained contextual lookup builder overflows
(#2404, #2411).
- [bezierTools] Fixed two floating-point bugs: one when computing `t` for a
point
  lying on an almost horizontal/vertical line; another when computing the
intersection
  point between a curve and a line (#2413).
