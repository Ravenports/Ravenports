What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.7
or later.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.33.3 (released 2022-04-26)
----------------------------

- [designspaceLib] Fixed typo in deepcopyExceptFonts method, preventing
font
  references to be transferred (#2600). Fixed another typo in the name of
Range
  dataclass's __post_init__ magic method (#2597).

4.33.2 (released 2022-04-22)
----------------------------

- [otBase] Make logging less verbose when harfbuzz fails to serialize. Do
not exit
  at the first failure but continue attempting to fix offset overflow error
using
  the pure-python serializer even when the USE_HARFBUZZ_REPACKER option was
  explicitly set to True. This is normal with fonts with relatively large
  tables, at least until hb.repack implements proper table splitting.

4.33.1 (released 2022-04-22)
----------------------------

- [otlLib] Put back the FONTTOOLS_GPOS_COMPACT_MODE environment variable to
fix
  regression in ufo2ft (and thus fontmake) introduced with v4.33.0 (#2592,
#2593).
  This is deprecated and will be removed one ufo2ft gets updated to use the
new
  config setup.

4.33.0 (released 2022-04-21)
----------------------------

- [OS/2 / merge] Automatically recalculate ``OS/2.xAvgCharWidth after
merging
  fonts with fontTools.merge`` (#2591, #2538).
- [misc/config] Added ``fontTools.misc.configTools`` module, a generic
configuration
  system (#2416, #2439).  
  Added ``fontTools.config`` module, a fontTools-specific configuration
  system using configTools above.  
  Attached a Config object to TTFont.
- [otlLib] Replaced environment variable for GPOS compression level with an
  equivalent option using the new config system.
- [designspaceLib] Incremented format version to 5.0 (#2436).  
  Added discrete axes, variable fonts, STAT information, either design- or
  user-space location on instances.  
  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.split`` module to split a designspace
  into sub-spaces that interpolate and that represent the variable fonts
  listed in the document.  
  Made instance names optional and allow computing them from STAT data
instead.
  Added ``fontTools.designspaceLib.statNames`` module.  
  Allow instances to have the same location as a previously defined STAT
label.  
  Deprecated some attributes:  
  SourceDescriptor: copyLib, copyInfo, copyGroups, copyFeatures.  
  InstanceDescriptor: kerning, info; glyphs: use rules or sparse
  sources.  
  For both, location: use the more explicit designLocation.  
  Note: all are soft deprecations and existing code should keep working.  
  Updated documentation for Python methods and the XML format.
- [varLib] Added build_many to build several variable fonts from a single
  designspace document (#2436).  
  Added ``fontTools.varLib.stat`` module to build STAT tables from a
designspace
  document.
- [otBase] Try to use the Harfbuzz Repacker for packing GSUB/GPOS tables
when
  uharfbuzz python bindings are available (#2552). Disable it by setting
