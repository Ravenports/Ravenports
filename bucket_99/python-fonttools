What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.8
or later. We try to follow the same schedule of minimum Python version
support as
NumPy (see [NEP 29]).

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.43.1 (released 2023-10-06)
----------------------------

- [EBDT] Fixed TypeError exception in `_reverseBytes` method triggered when
dumping
  some bitmap fonts with `ttx -z bitwise` option (#3162).
- [v/hhea] Fixed UnboundLocalError exception in recalc method when no vmtx
or hmtx
  tables are present (#3290).
- [bezierTools] Fixed incorrectly typed cython local variable leading to
TypeError when
  calling calcQuadraticArcLength (#3288).
- [feaLib/otlLib] Better error message when building Coverage table with
missing glyph (#3286).

4.43.0 (released 2023-09-29)
----------------------------

- [subset] Set up lxml ``XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)`` when parsing
OT-SVG documents
  to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks (9f61271dc):
  https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/python/py-xxe/
- [varLib.iup] Added workaround for a Cython bug in iup_delta_optimize that
was
  leading to IUP tolerance being incorrectly initialised, resulting in
sub-optimal deltas
  (60126435d, cython/cython#5732).
- [varLib] Added new command-line entry point ``fonttools varLib.avar to
add an
  avar`` table to an existing VF from axes mappings in a .designspace file
(0a3360e52).
- [instancer] Fixed bug whereby no longer used variation regions were not
correctly pruned
  after VarData optimization (#3268).
- Added support for Python 3.12 (#3283).

4.42.1 (released 2023-08-20)
----------------------------

- [t1Lib] Fixed several Type 1 issues (#3238, #3240).
- [otBase/packer] Allow sharing tables reached by different offset sizes
(#3241, #3236).
- [varLib/merger] Fix Cursive attachment merging error when all anchors are
NULL (#3248, #3247).
- [ttLib] Fixed warning when calling addMultilingualName and ttFont
parameter was not
  passed on to findMultilingualName (#3253).

4.42.0 (released 2023-08-02)
----------------------------

- [varLib] Use sentinel value 0xFFFF to mark a glyph advance in hmtx/vmtx
as non
  participating, allowing sparse masters to contain glyphs for variation
purposes other
  than {H,V}VAR (#3235).
- [varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in non-default masters as missing, thus
not participating
  in CFF2 delta computation, similarly to how varLib already treats them
for gvar (#3234).
- Added varLib.avarPlanner script to deduce 'correct' avar v1 axis mappings
based on
  glyph average weights (#3223).

4.41.1 (released 2023-07-21)
----------------------------

- [subset] Fixed perf regression in v4.41.0 by making NameRecordVisitor
only visit
