What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.27.1 (released 2021-09-23)
----------------------------

- [otlLib] Fixed error when chained contextual lookup builder overflows
(#2404, #2411).
- [bezierTools] Fixed two floating-point bugs: one when computing `t` for a
point
  lying on an almost horizontal/vertical line; another when computing the
intersection
  point between a curve and a line (#2413).

4.27.0 (released 2021-09-14)
----------------------------

- [ttLib/otTables] Cleaned up virtual GID handling: allow virtual GIDs in
Coverage
  and ClassDef readers; removed unused allowVID argument from TTFont
  constructor, and requireReal argument in ``TTFont.getGlyphID`` method.
  Make ``TTFont.setGlyphOrder`` clear reverse glyphOrder map, and assume
glyphOrder
  internal attribute is never modified outside setGlyphOrder; added
``TTFont.getGlyphNameMany
  and getGlyphIDMany`` (#1536, #1654, #2334, #2398).
- [py23] Dropped internal use of ``fontTools.py23`` module to fix
deprecation warnings
  in client code that imports from fontTools (#2234, #2399, #2400).
- [subset] Fix subsetting COLRv1 clip boxes when font is loaded lazily
(#2408).

4.26.2 (released 2021-08-09)
----------------------------

- [otTables] Added missing ``CompositeMode.PLUS`` operator (#2390).

4.26.1 (released 2021-08-03)
----------------------------

- [transform] Added transformVector and transformVectors methods to the
  Transform class. Similar to transformPoint but ignore the translation
  part (#2386).

4.26.0 (released 2021-08-03)
----------------------------

- [xmlWriter] Default to ``"\n" for newlinestr`` instead of
platform-specific
  ``os.linesep`` (#2384).
- [otData] Define COLRv1 ClipList and ClipBox (#2379).
- [removeOverlaps/instancer] Added --ignore-overlap-errors option to work
around
  Skia PathOps.Simplify bug (#2382, #2363, google/fonts#3365).
- NOTE: This will be the last version to support Python 3.6. FontTools will
require
  Python 3.7 or above from the next release (#2350)

4.25.2 (released 2021-07-26)
----------------------------

- [COLRv1] Various changes to sync with the latest CORLv1 draft spec. In
particular:  
  define COLR.VarIndexMap, remove/inline ColorIndex struct, add
VarIndexBase to ``PaintVar*`` tables (#2372);  
  add reduced-precicion specialized transform Paints;  
  define Angle as fraction of half circle encoded as F2Dot14;
