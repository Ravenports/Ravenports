What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.8.1 (released 2020-04-17)
---------------------------

- [feaLib] Fixed ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' has no attribute
'getAlternateGlyphs'
  when aalt`` feature references a chain contextual substitution lookup
  (googlefonts/fontmake#648, #1878).

4.8.0 (released 2020-04-16)
---------------------------

- [feaLib] If Parser is initialized without a glyphNames parameter, it
cannot
  distinguish between a glyph name containing an hyphen, or a range of
glyph names;
  instead of raising an error, it now interprets them as literal glyph
names, while
  also outputting a logging warning to alert user about the ambiguity
(#1768, #1870).
- [feaLib] When serializing AST to string, emit spaces around hyphens that
denote
  ranges. Also, fixed an issue with CID ranges when round-tripping
AST->string->AST
  (#1872).
- [Snippets/otf2ttf] In otf2ttf.py script update LSB in hmtx to match xMin
(#1873).
- [colorLib] Added experimental support for building COLR v1 tables as per
  the `colr-gradients-spec
<https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/blob/master/colr-gradients-spec.md>`__
  draft proposal. **NOTE**: both the API and the XML dump of COLR v1 are
  susceptible to change while the proposal is being discussed and
formalized (#1822).

4.7.0 (released 2020-04-03)
---------------------------

- [cu2qu] Added ``fontTools.cu2qu`` package, imported from the original
  [cu2qu] project. The ``cu2qu.pens module
  was moved to fontTools.pens.cu2quPen``. The optional cu2qu extension
module
  can be compiled by installing [Cython] before installing
  fonttools from source (i.e. git repo or sdist tarball). The wheel package
that
  is published on PyPI (i.e. the one pip downloads, unless ``--no-binary``
  option is used), will continue to be pure-Python for now (#1868).

4.6.0 (released 2020-03-24)
---------------------------

- [varLib] Added support for building variable BASE table version 1.1
(#1858).
- [CPAL] Added fromRGBA method to Color class (#1861).

4.5.0 (released 2020-03-20)
---------------------------

- [designspaceLib] Added ``add{Axis,Source,Instance,Rule}Descriptor methods
to
  DesignSpaceDocument`` class, to initialize new descriptor objects using
keyword
  arguments, and at the same time append them to the current document
(#1860).
- [unicodedata] Update to Unicode 13.0 (#1859).

4.4.3 (released 2020-03-13)
---------------------------
