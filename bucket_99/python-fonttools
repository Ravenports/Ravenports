What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.20.0 (released 2021-02-15)
----------------------------

- [COLRv1] Added unbuildColrV1 to deconstruct COLRv1 otTables to raw
json-able
  data structure; it does the reverse of buildColrV1 (#2171).
- [feaLib] Allow sub X by NULL sequence to delete a glyph (#2170).
- [arrayTools] Fixed Vector division (#2173).
- [COLRv1] Define new PaintSweepGradient (#2172).
- [otTables] Moved ``Paint.Format enum class outside of Paint`` class
definition,
  now named PaintFormat. It was clashing with paint instance Format
attribute
  and thus was breaking lazy load of COLR table which relies on magic
__getattr__
  (#2175).
- [COLRv1] Replace hand-coded builder functions with otData-driven dynamic
  implementation (#2181).
- [COLRv1] Define additional static (non-variable) Paint formats (#2181).
- [fontBuilder] Allow setupFvar to optionally take
``designspaceLib.AxisDescriptor``
  objects. Added new setupAvar method. Support localised names for axes and
  named instances (#2185).

4.19.1 (released 2021-01-28)
----------------------------

- [woff2] An initial off-curve point with an overlap flag now stays an
off-curve
  point after compression.

4.19.0 (released 2021-01-25)
----------------------------

- [codecs] Handle errors parameter different from 'strict' for the custom
  extended mac encodings (#2137, #2132).
- [featureVars] Raise better error message when a script is missing the
required
  default language system (#2154).
- [COLRv1] Avoid abrupt change caused by rounding
``PaintRadialGradient.c0`` when
  the start circle almost touches the end circle's perimeter (#2148).
- [COLRv1] Support building unlimited lists of paints as 255-ary trees of
  PaintColrLayers tables (#2153).
- [subset] Prune redundant format-12 cmap subtables when all non-BMP
characters
  are dropped (#2146).
- [basePen] Raise MissingComponentError instead of bare KeyError when a
  referenced component is missing (#2145).

4.18.2 (released 2020-12-16)
----------------------------

- [COLRv1] Implemented PaintTranslate paint format (#2129).
- [varLib.cff] Fixed unbound local variable error (#1787).
- [otlLib] Don't crash when creating OpenType class definitions if some
glyphs
  occur more than once (#2125).

4.18.1 (released 2020-12-09)
----------------------------

- [colorLib] Speed optimization for LayerV1ListBuilder (#2119).
- [mutator] Fixed missing tab in interpolate_cff2_metrics (0957dc7a).
