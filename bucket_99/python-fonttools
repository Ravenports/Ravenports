What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools requires [Python] 3.8
or later. We try to follow the same schedule of minimum Python version
support as
NumPy (see [NEP 29]).

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.41.0 (released 2023-07-12)
----------------------------

- [fontBuilder] Fixed bug in setupOS2 with default panose attribute
incorrectly being
  set to a dict instead of a Panose object (#3201).
- [name] Added method to removeUnusedNameRecords in the user range (#3185).
- [varLib.instancer] Fixed issue with L4 instancing (moving default)
(#3179).
- [cffLib] Use latin1 so we can roundtrip non-ASCII in
{Full,Font,Family}Name (#3202).
- [designspaceLib] Mark <source name="..."> as optional in docs (as it is
in the code).
- [glyf-1] Fixed drawPoints() bug whereby last cubic segment becomes
quadratic (#3189, #3190).
- [fontBuilder] Propagate the 'hidden' flag to the fvar Axis instance
(#3184).
- [fontBuilder] Update setupAvar() to also support avar 2, fixing
``_add_avar()`` call
  site (#3183).
- Added new ``voltLib.voltToFea`` submodule (originally Tiro Typeworks'
"Volto") for
  converting VOLT OpenType Layout sources to FEA format (#3164).

4.40.0 (released 2023-06-12)
----------------------------

- Published native binary wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions
and platform
  and architectures currently supported that would benefit from this. They
will include
  precompiled Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to
compile them
  from source. The pure-python wheel and source distribution will continue
to be
  published as always (pip will automatically chose them when no binary
wheel is
  available for the given platform, e.g. pypy). Use ``pip install
--no-binary=fonttools fonttools``
  to expliclity request pip to install from the pure-python source.
- [designspaceLib|varLib] Add initial support for specifying axis mappings
and build
  avar2 table from those (#3123).
- [feaLib] Support variable ligature caret position (#3130).
- [varLib|glyf] Added option to --drop-implied-oncurves; test for impliable
oncurve
  points either before or after rounding (#3146, #3147, #3155, #3156).
- [TTGlyphPointPen] Don't error with empty contours, simply ignore them
(#3145).
- [sfnt] Fixed str vs bytes remnant of py3 transition in code dealing with
de/compiling
  WOFF metadata (#3129).
- [instancer-solver] Fixed bug when moving default instance with sparse
masters (#3139, #3140).
- [feaLib] Simplify variable scalars that donâ€™t vary (#3132).
- [pens] Added filter pen that explicitly emits closing line when lastPt !=
movePt (#3100).
- [varStore] Improve optimize algorithm and better document the algorithm
(#3124, #3127).
  Added quantization option (#3126).
- Added CI workflow config file for building native binary wheels (#3121).
- [fontBuilder] Added glyphDataFormat=0 option; raise error when glyphs
contain cubic
  outlines but glyphDataFormat was not explicitly set to 1 (#3113, #3119).
- [subset] Prune emptied GDEF.MarkGlyphSetsDef and remap indices; ensure
GDEF is
  subsetted before GSUB and GPOS (#3114, #3118).
- [xmlReader] Fixed issue whereby DSIG table data was incorrectly parsed
(#3115, #2614).
