What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)
----------------------------

- [removeOverlaps] Added new module and removeOverlaps function that merges
  overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the
  `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.
  Note that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).
- [varLib.instancer] Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.
  The overlap option in instantiateVariableFont now takes an OverlapMode
  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS, 1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2:
REMOVE.
  The latter is equivalent to calling removeOverlaps on the generated
static
  instance. The option continues to accept bool value for backward
compatibility.

4.15.0 (released 2020-09-21)
----------------------------

- [plistlib] Added typing annotations to plistlib module. Set up mypy
static
  typechecker to run automatically on CI (#2061).
- [ttLib] Implement private Debg table, a reverse-DNS namespaced JSON dict.
- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the Debg table with the original
  lookup name (if any), feature name / script / language combination (if
any),
  and original source filename and line location. Annotate the ttx output
for
  a lookup with the information from the Debg table (#2052).
- [sfnt] Disabled checksum checking by default in SFNTReader (#2058).
- [Docs] Document mtiLib module (#2027).
- [varLib.interpolatable] Added checks for contour node count and operation
type
  of each node (#2054).
- [ttLib] Added API to register custom table packer/unpacker classes
(#2055).

4.14.0 (released 2020-08-19)
----------------------------

- [feaLib] Allow anonymous classes in LookupFlags definitions (#2037).
- [Docs] Better document DesignSpace rules processing order (#2041).
- [ttLib] Fixed 21-year old bug in ``maxp.maxComponentDepth`` calculation
(#2044,
  #2045).
- [varLib.models] Fixed misspelled argument name in CLI entry point
(81d0042a).
- [subset] When subsetting GSUB v1.1, fixed TypeError by checking whether
the
  optional FeatureVariations table is present (e63ecc5b).
- [Snippets] Added snippet to show how to decompose glyphs in a TTF
(#2030).
- [otlLib] Generate GSUB type 5 and GPOS type 7 contextual lookups where
appropriate
  (#2016).

4.13.0 (released 2020-07-10)
----------------------------

- [feaLib/otlLib] Moved lookup subtable builders from feaLib to otlLib;
refactored
  some common code (#2004, #2007).
- [docs] Document otlLib module (#2009).
