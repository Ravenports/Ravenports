What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.22.1 (released 2021-04-26)
----------------------------

- [feaLib] Skip references to named lookups if the lookup block definition
  is empty, similarly to makeotf. This also fixes an AttributeError while
  generating aalt feature (#2276, #2277).
- [subset] Fixed bug with ``--no-hinting`` implementation for Device tables
(#2272,
  #2275). The previous code was alwyas dropping Device tables if no-hinting
was
  requested, but some Device tables (DeltaFormat=0x8000) are also used to
encode
  variation indices and need to be retained.
- [otBase] Fixed bug in getting the ValueRecordSize when decompiling MVAR
  table with ``lazy=True`` (#2273, #2274).
- [varLib/glyf/gvar] Optimized and simplified GlyphCoordinates and
  TupleVariation classes, use bytearray where possible, refactored
  phantom-points calculations. We measured about 30% speedup in total time
  of loading master ttfs, building gvar, and saving (#2261, #2266).
- [subset] Fixed AssertionError while pruning unused CPAL palettes when
  0xFFFF is present (#2257, #2259).

4.22.0 (released 2021-04-01)
----------------------------

- [ttLib] Remove .Format from Coverage, ClassDef, SingleSubst,
LigatureSubst,
  AlternateSubst, MultipleSubst (#2238).
  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!
- [misc.arrayTools] move Vector to its own submodule, and rewrite as a
tuple
  subclass (#2201).
- [docs] Added a terminology section for varLib (#2209).
- [varLib] Move rounding to VariationModel, to avoid error accumulation
from
  multiple deltas (#2214)
- [varLib] Explain merge errors in more human-friendly terms (#2223, #2226)
- [otlLib] Correct some documentation (#2225)
- [varLib/otlLib] Allow merging into VariationFont without first saving
GPOS
  PairPos2 (#2229)
- [subset] Improve PairPosFormat2 subsetting (#2221)
- [ttLib] TTFont.save: create file on disk as late as possible (#2253)
- [cffLib] Add missing CFF2 dict operators LanguageGroup and
ExpansionFactor
  (#2249)
  ATTENTION: This will change your TTX dumps!

4.21.1 (released 2021-02-26)
----------------------------

- [pens] Reverted breaking change that turned AbstractPen and
AbstractPointPen
  into abstract base classes (#2164, #2198).

4.21.0 (released 2021-02-26)
----------------------------

- [feaLib] Indent anchor statements in ``asFea()`` to make them more
legible and
  diff-able (#2193).
- [pens] Turn AbstractPen and AbstractPointPen into abstract base classes
  (#2164).
- [feaLib] Added support for parsing and building STAT table from AFDKO
