What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can
install it with [pip]:

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

4.17.1 (released 2020-11-16)
----------------------------

- [colorLib] Fixed regression in 4.17.0 when building COLR v0 table; when
color
  layers are stored in UFO lib plist, we can't distinguish tuples from
lists so
  we need to accept either types (e5439eb9, googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues#426).

4.17.0 (released 2020-11-12)
----------------------------

- [colorLib/otData] Updated to latest draft COLR v1 spec (#2092).
- [svgLib] Fixed parsing error when arc commands' boolean flags are not
separated
  by space or comma (#2094).
- [varLib] Interpret empty non-default glyphs as 'missing', if the default
glyph is
  not empty (#2082).
- [feaLib.builder] Only stash lookup location for Debg if
``Builder.buildLookups_``
  has cooperated (#2065, #2067).
- [varLib] Fixed bug in VarStore optimizer (#2073, #2083).
- [varLib] Add designspace lib key for custom feavar feature tag (#2080).
- Add HashPointPen adapted from psautohint. With this pen, a hash value of
a glyph
  can be computed, which can later be used to detect glyph changes (#2005).

4.16.1 (released 2020-10-05)
----------------------------

- [varLib.instancer] Fixed TypeError exception when instantiating a VF with
  a GSUB table 1.1 in which FeatureVariations attribute is present but set
to
  None -- indicating that optional FeatureVariations is missing (#2077).
- [glifLib] Make x and y attributes of the point element required
  even when validation is turned off, and raise a meaningful GlifLibError
  message when that happens (#2075).

4.16.0 (released 2020-09-30)
----------------------------

- [removeOverlaps] Added new module and removeOverlaps function that merges
  overlapping contours and components in TrueType glyphs. It requires the
  `skia-pathops <https://github.com/fonttools/skia-pathops>`__ module.
  Note that removing overlaps invalidates the TrueType hinting (#2068).
- [varLib.instancer] Added ``--remove-overlaps`` command-line option.
  The overlap option in instantiateVariableFont now takes an OverlapMode
  enum: 0: KEEP_AND_DONT_SET_FLAGS, 1: KEEP_AND_SET_FLAGS (default), and 2:
REMOVE.
  The latter is equivalent to calling removeOverlaps on the generated
static
  instance. The option continues to accept bool value for backward
compatibility.

4.15.0 (released 2020-09-21)
----------------------------

- [plistlib] Added typing annotations to plistlib module. Set up mypy
static
  typechecker to run automatically on CI (#2061).
- [ttLib] Implement private Debg table, a reverse-DNS namespaced JSON dict.
- [feaLib] Optionally add an entry into the Debg table with the original
