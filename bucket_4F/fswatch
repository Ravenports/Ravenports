[FILE:801:descriptions/desc.primary]
fswatch is a file change monitor that receives notifications when the
contents of the specified files or directories are modified. fswatch
implements four kinds of monitors:

  * A monitor based on the File System Events API of Apple OS X.
  * A monitor based on kqueue, an event notification interface introduced
    in FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most *BSD systems (including OS X).
  * A monitor based on inotify, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file
    system changes to applications.
  * A monitor which periodically stats the file system, saves file
    modification times in memory and manually calculates file system
    changes, which can work on any operating system having stat (2).

fswatch should build and work correctly on any system shipping either of
the aforementioned APIs.
