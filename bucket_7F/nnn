nnn is a fast and resource-sensitive file browser which integrates well with
your DE and favorite GUI utilities, works with the desktop opener, supports
bookmarks, has smart navigation shortcuts, has navigate-as-you-type mode,
disk usage analyzer mode, comprehensive file details and much more.

  - open any file in the default desktop application or a custom one
  - navigate-as-you-type (search-as-you-type enabled even on directory
    switch)
  - check disk usage with number of files in current directory tree
  - run desktop search utility (gnome-search-tool or catfish) in any
    directory
  - copy absolute file path to clipboard, spawn a terminal and use the file
    path
  - navigate instantly using shortcuts like ~, -, & or handy bookmarks
  - use cd ..... at chdir prompt to go to a parent directory
  - show detailed file stats, media info, list and extract archives
