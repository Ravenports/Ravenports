[FILE:523:descriptions/desc.single]
Ninja is yet another build system. It takes as input the interdependencies
of files (typically source code and output executables) and orchestrates
building them, quickly.

Ninja joins a sea of other build systems. Its distinguishing goal is to be
fast. It is born from my work on the Chromium browser project, which has
over 30,000 source files and whose other build systems (including one built
from custom non-recursive Makefiles) can take ten seconds to start building
after changing one file. Ninja is under a second.
