# Need To Graph

N2G is a library to generate diagrams in [yWorks] graphml or [Diagrams]
drawio formats or produce JSON data compatible with [3d-force-graph JSON
input syntax]
allowing 3D visualization.

## Why?

To save your time on producing consistently looking, editable diagrams of
arbitrary size and complexity in a programmatic way helping to satisfy your
"Need To Graph" desire.

## How?

Not a secret that many applications use XML structured text to save their
diagrams content, then why not to do the opposite - produce XML structured
text that applications can open and understand and work with. N2G does
exactly that, it takes structured data - csv, dictionary, list or api calls
and gives back XML text that can be opened and edited by application of
choice.

## What?

All formats supported so far have very similar API capable of:

* adding nodes and links with various attributes such as shape, labels,
urls, data, styles
* bulk graph creation using from_x methods supporting lists, dictionaries
or csv data
* existing nodes and links attributes manipulation and update
* loading existing XML diagram files for processing and modification
* deletion of nodes and links from diagrams
* comparing two diagrams to highlight the difference between them
* layout your diagram with algorithms available in [igraph] library
* returning results in text format or saving directly into the file

Reference [documentation] for more information.

## What it's not?

N2G is not a magic bullet that will produce perfect diagrams for you, it
can help to simplify the process of adding elements to your diagrams.
However, (manual) efforts required to put all the elements in positions
where they will satisfy your inner sense of perfection, as a result, keep
in mind that (normally) the more elements you have on your diagram, the
more efforts required to make it looks good.

Quite unlikely it would ever be a tool with support of all capabilities
available in subject applications, however, feature requests are welcomed.

## Example

```python
from N2G import yed_diagram

diagram = yed_diagram()
sample_list_graph = [
    {'source': {'id': 'SW1', 'top_label': 'CORE', 'bottom_label':
'1,1,1,1'}, 'src_label': 'Gig0/0', 'target': 'R1', 'trgt_label': 'Gig0/1'},
    {'source': {'id': 'R2', 'top_label': 'DC-PE'}, 'src_label': 'Gig0/0',
'target': 'SW1', 'trgt_label': 'Gig0/2'},
    {'source': {'id':'R3', 'bottom_label': '1.1.1.3'}, 'src_label':
'Gig0/0', 'target': 'SW1', 'trgt_label': 'Gig0/3'},
    {'source': 'SW1', 'src_label': 'Gig0/4', 'target': 'R4', 'trgt_label':
'Gig0/1'},
    {'source': 'SW1', 'src_label': 'Gig0/5', 'target': 'R5', 'trgt_label':
'Gig0/7'},
    {'source': 'SW1', 'src_label': 'Gig0/6', 'target': 'R6', 'trgt_label':
'Gig0/11'}
]
diagram.from_list(sample_list_graph)
diagram.dump_file(filename="Sample_graph.graphml", folder="./")
```

# Disclaimer

Author of this module not affiliated with any of the application Vendors
mentioned so far. The choice of formats to support was primarily driven by
the fact of how much functionality available in particular application for
free. Moreover, this module does not use any aforementioned (diagramming)
applications in any programmatic way to produce its results, in other
words, none of the aforementioned applications required to be installed on
the system for this (N2G) module to work.
