======
Pylint
======

**It's not just a linter that annoys you!**

Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming
errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple
refactoring
suggestions.

It's highly configurable, having special pragmas to control its errors and
warnings
from within your code, as well as from an extensive configuration file.
It is also possible to write your own plugins for adding your own checks or
for
extending pylint in one way or another.

It's a free software distributed under the GNU General Public Licence
unless
otherwise specified.

Development is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/

You can use the code-quality@python.org mailing list to discuss about
Pylint. Subscribe at https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality/
