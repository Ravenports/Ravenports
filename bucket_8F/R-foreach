foreach: Provides Foreach Looping Construct

Support for the foreach looping construct. Foreach is an idiom that allows
for iterating over elements in a collection, without the use of an explicit
loop counter. This package in particular is intended to be used for its
return value, rather than for its side effects. In that sense, it is
similar to the standard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation
of a function. Using foreach without side effects also facilitates
executing the loop in parallel.
