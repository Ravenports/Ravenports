[FILE:877:descriptions/desc.primary]
librsync is a library for calculating and applying network deltas, with an
interface designed to ease integration into diverse network applications.

librsync encapsulates the core algorithms of the rsync protocol, which help
with efficient calculation of the differences between two files. The rsync
algorithm is different from most differencing algorithms because it does
not require the presence of the two files to calculate the delta. Instead,
it requires a set of checksums of each block of one file, which together
form a signature for that file. Blocks at any in the other file which have
the same checksum are likely to be identical, and whatever remains is the
difference.

This algorithm transfers the differences between two files without needing
both files on the same system.  librsync is for building other programs
that transfer files as efficiently as rsync.
