## Quickstart

They say [a good example is worth] 100 pages of API documentation, a
million directives, or a thousand words.

Well, "they" probably lie... but here's an example anyway:

```python
from transitions import Machine
import random

class NarcolepticSuperhero(object):

    # Define some states. Most of the time, narcoleptic superheroes are
just like
    # everyone else. Except for...
    states = ['asleep', 'hanging out', 'hungry', 'sweaty', 'saving the
world']

    def __init__(self, name):

        # No anonymous superheroes on my watch! Every narcoleptic superhero
gets
        # a name. Any name at all. SleepyMan. SlumberGirl. You get the
idea.
        self.name = name

        # What have we accomplished today?
        self.kittens_rescued = 0

        # Initialize the state machine
        self.machine = Machine(model=self,
states=NarcolepticSuperhero.states, initial='asleep')

        # Add some transitions. We could also define these using a static
list of
        # dictionaries, as we did with states above, and then pass the list
to
        # the Machine initializer as the transitions= argument.

        # At some point, every superhero must rise and shine.
        self.machine.add_transition(trigger='wake_up', source='asleep',
dest='hanging out')

        # Superheroes need to keep in shape.
        self.machine.add_transition('work_out', 'hanging out', 'hungry')

        # Those calories won't replenish themselves!
        self.machine.add_transition('eat', 'hungry', 'hanging out')

        # Superheroes are always on call. ALWAYS. But they're not always
        # dressed in work-appropriate clothing.
        self.machine.add_transition('distress_call', '*', 'saving the
world',
                         before='change_into_super_secret_costume')

        # When they get off work, they're all sweaty and disgusting. But
before
        # they do anything else, they have to meticulously log their latest
        # escapades. Because the legal department says so.
        self.machine.add_transition('complete_mission', 'saving the world',
'sweaty',
                         after='update_journal')

        # Sweat is a disorder that can be remedied with water.
        # Unless you've had a particularly long day, in which case... bed
time!
        self.machine.add_transition('clean_up', 'sweaty', 'asleep',
conditions=['is_exhausted'])
        self.machine.add_transition('clean_up', 'sweaty', 'hanging out')

        # Our NarcolepticSuperhero can fall asleep at pretty much any time.
        self.machine.add_transition('nap', '*', 'asleep')

    def update_journal(self):
        """ Dear Diary, today I saved Mr. Whiskers. Again. """
        self.kittens_rescued += 1

    @property
    def is_exhausted(self):
        """ Basically a coin toss. """
        return random.random() < 0.5

    def change_into_super_secret_costume(self):
        print("Beauty, eh?")
```

There, now you've baked a state machine into `NarcolepticSuperhero`. Let's
take him/her/it out for a spin...

```python
>>> batman = NarcolepticSuperhero("Batman")
>>> batman.state
'asleep'

>>> batman.wake_up()
>>> batman.state
'hanging out'

>>> batman.nap()
