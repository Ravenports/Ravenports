## INTRODUCTION

`dnspython` is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record
types. It
can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates. It supports
TSIG-authenticated messages and EDNS0.

`dnspython` provides both high- and low-level access to DNS. The high-level
classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and class, and
return an
answer set. The low-level classes allow direct manipulation of DNS zones,
messages, names, and records.

To see a few of the ways `dnspython` can be used, look in the `examples/`
directory.

`dnspython` is a utility to work with DNS, `/etc/hosts` is thus not used.
For
simple forward DNS lookups, it's better to use `socket.getaddrinfo()` or
`socket.gethostbyname()`.

`dnspython` originated at Nominum where it was developed to facilitate the
testing of DNS software.

## ABOUT THIS RELEASE

This is of `dnspython` 2.8.0.
Please read
[What's New] for
information about the changes in this release.

## INSTALLATION

* Many distributions have dnspython packaged for you, so you should check
there
  first.
* To use a wheel downloaded from PyPi, run:

`
    pip install dnspython
`

* To install from the source code, go into the top-level of the source code
  and run:

```
    pip install --upgrade pip build
    python -m build
    pip install dist/*.whl
```

* To install the latest from the main branch, run
`pip install git+https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython.git`

`dnspython`'s default installation does not depend on any modules other
than
those in the Python standard library.  To use some features, additional
modules
must be installed.  For convenience, `pip` options are defined for the
requirements.

If you want to use DNS-over-HTTPS, run
`pip install dnspython[doh]`.

If you want to use DNSSEC functionality, run
`pip install dnspython[dnssec]`.

If you want to use internationalized domain names (IDNA)
functionality, you must run
`pip install dnspython[idna]`

If you want to use the Trio asynchronous I/O package, run
`pip install dnspython[trio]`.

If you want to use WMI on Windows to determine the active DNS settings
instead of the default registry scanning method, run
`pip install dnspython[wmi]`.

If you want to try the experimental DNS-over-QUIC code, run
`pip install dnspython[doq]`.

Note that you can install any combination of the above, e.g.:
`pip install dnspython[doh,dnssec,idna]`

### Notices

Python 2.x support ended with the release of 1.16.0.  `dnspython` supports
Python 3.10
and later.  Future support is aligned with the lifetime of the Python 3
versions.
