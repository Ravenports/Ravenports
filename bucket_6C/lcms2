Little CMS intends to be a small-footprint color management engine, with
special focus on accuracy and performance.  It uses the International Color
Consortium standard (ICC), which is the modern standard when regarding to
color management.  The ICC specification is widely used and is referred to
in many International and other de-facto standards.  It was approved as an
International Standard, ISO 15076-1, in 2005.

Since version 2.1, Little CMS fully implements ICC specification 4.2 plus
all addendums; it fully supports all kind of V2 and V4 profiles, including
abstract, devicelink, and named color profiles.

Color management refers to techniques that ensure consistent colors while
images are transferred from scanners or cameras to monitors and printers.
