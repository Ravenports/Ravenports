[FILE:521:descriptions/desc.static]
The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding).  It
is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined
semantics.  It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for
double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).

This package contains the headers and static library.

The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding).  It
is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

This package contains the shared library.
