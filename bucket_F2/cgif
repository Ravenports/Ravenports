[FILE:923:descriptions/desc.primary]
Cgif is a fast and lightweight GIF encoder that can create GIF animations
and images. Summary of the main features:

* user-defined global or local color-palette with up to 256 colors (limit 
of the GIF format)
* size-optimizations for GIF animations:
  - option to set a pixel to transparent if it has identical color in the 
previous frame (transparency optimization)
  - do encoding just for the rectangular area that differs from the 
previous frame (width/height optimization)
* fast: a GIF with 256 colors and 1024x1024 pixels can be created in below 
50 ms even on a minimalistic system
* MIT license (permissive)
* different options for GIF animations: static image, N repetitions, 
infinite repetitions
* additional source-code for verifying the encoder after making changes
* user-defined delay time from one frame to the next (can be set 
independently for each frame)
* source-code conforms to the C99 standard
