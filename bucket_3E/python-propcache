Introduction
------------

The API is designed to be nearly identical to the built-in
``functools.cached_property`` class,
except for the additional under_cached_property class which uses
``self._cache
instead of self.__dict__ to store the cached values and prevents __set__``
from being called.

For full documentation please read https://propcache.readthedocs.io.

Installation
------------

::

   $ pip install propcache

The library is Python 3 only!

PyPI contains binary wheels for Linux, Windows and MacOS.  If you want to
install
propcache on another operating system where wheels are not provided,
the the tarball will be used to compile the library from
the source code. It requires a C compiler and and Python headers installed.

To skip the compilation you must explicitly opt-in by using a PEP 517
configuration setting ``pure-python``, or setting the
PROPCACHE_NO_EXTENSIONS
environment variable to a non-empty value, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install propcache --config-settings=pure-python=false

Please note that the pure-Python (uncompiled) version is much slower.
However,
PyPy always uses a pure-Python implementation, and, as such, it is
unaffected
by this variable.
