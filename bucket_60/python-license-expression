license-expression
==================

``license-expression`` is a comprehensive utility library to parse,
compare,
simplify and normalize license expressions (such as SPDX license
expressions)
using boolean logic.

- License: Apache-2.0
- Python: 3.9+
- Homepage: https://github.com/aboutcode-org/license-expression/
- Install: `pip install license-expression` also available in most Linux
distro.

Software project licenses are often a combination of several free and open
source software licenses. License expressions -- as specified by SPDX --
provide
a concise and human readable way to express these licenses without having
to
read long license texts, while still being machine-readable.

License expressions are used by key FOSS projects such as Linux; several
packages ecosystem use them to document package licensing metadata such as
npm and Rubygems; they are important when exchanging software data (such as
with
SPDX and SBOM in general) as a way to express licensing precisely.

``license-expression`` is a comprehensive utility library to parse,
compare,
simplify and normalize these license expressions (such as SPDX license
expressions)
using boolean logic like in: `GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Classpath-exception-2.0
AND MIT`.

It includes the license keys from SPDX https://spdx.org/licenses/ (version
3.26)
and ScanCode LicenseDB (from scancode-toolkit version 32.3.1, last
published on 2025-01-10).
See https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/ to get started quickly.

``license-expression`` is both powerful and simple to use and is a used as
the
license expression engine in several projects and products such as:

``license-expression`` is also packaged for most Linux distributions. See

similar
libraries in other languages (but not as powerful of course!):
