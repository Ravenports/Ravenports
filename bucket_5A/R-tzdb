tzdb: Time Zone Database Information

Provides an up-to-date copy of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) Time Zone Database. It is updated periodically to reflect changes
made by political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight
saving time rules. Additionally, this package provides a C++ interface for
working with the 'date' library. 'date' provides comprehensive support for
working with dates and date-times, which this package exposes to make it
easier for other R packages to utilize. Headers are provided for calendar
specific calculations, along with a limited interface for time zone
manipulations.
