Introduction
============

Most of the current formatters for Python --- e.g., autopep8, and pep8ify
---
are made to remove lint errors from code. This has some obvious
limitations.
For instance, code that conforms to the PEP 8 guidelines may not be
reformatted.  But it doesn't mean that the code looks good.

YAPF takes a different approach. It's based off of `'clang-format'
<https://cl
ang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>`_, developed by Daniel Jasper. In
essence,
the algorithm takes the code and reformats it to the best formatting that
conforms to the style guide, even if the original code didn't violate the
style guide. The idea is also similar to the ['gofmt'] tool for the Go
programming language: end all holy wars about
formatting - if the whole codebase of a project is simply piped through
YAPF
whenever modifications are made, the style remains consistent throughout
the
project and there's no point arguing about style in every code review.

The ultimate goal is that the code YAPF produces is as good as the code
that a
programmer would write if they were following the style guide. It takes
away
some of the drudgery of maintaining your code.

Try out YAPF with this [online demo].

    YAPF is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it
is
    just code that happens to be owned by Google.

Installation
============

To install YAPF from PyPI:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install yapf

(optional) If you are using Python 2.7 and want to enable multiprocessing:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install futures

YAPF is still considered in "alpha" stage, and the released version may
change
often; therefore, the best way to keep up-to-date with the latest
development
is to clone this repository.

Note that if you intend to use YAPF as a command-line tool rather than as a
library, installation is not necessary. YAPF supports being run as a
directory
by the Python interpreter. If you cloned/unzipped YAPF into DIR, it's
possible to run:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ PYTHONPATH=DIR python DIR/yapf [options] ...

Python versions
===============

YAPF supports Python 2.7 and 3.6.4+. (Note that some Python 3 features may
fail
to parse with Python versions before 3.6.4.)

YAPF requires the code it formats to be valid Python for the version YAPF
itself
runs under. Therefore, if you format Python 3 code with YAPF, run YAPF
itself
under Python 3 (and similarly for Python 2).

Usage
