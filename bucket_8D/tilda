[FILE:497:descriptions/desc.primary]
Tilda is a terminal emulator and can be compared with other popular
terminal emulators such as gnome-terminal (Gnome), Konsole (KDE), xterm
and many others. The specialities of Tilda are that it does not behave
like a normal window but instead it can be pulled up and down from the
top of the screen with a special hotkey. Additionally Tilda is highly
configurable. It is possible to configure the hotkeys for keybindings,
change the appearance and many options that affect the behavior of Tilda.
