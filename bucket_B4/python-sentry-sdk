# Official Sentry SDK for Python

Welcome to the official Python SDK for **[Sentry]**.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a Sentry [account] and [project].

### Installation

Getting Sentry into your project is straightforward. Just run this command
in your terminal:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

### Basic Configuration

Here's a quick configuration example to get Sentry up and running:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "https://12927b5f211046b575ee51fd8b1ac34f@o1.ingest.sentry.io/1",  #
Your DSN here

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of traces for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

With this configuration, Sentry will monitor for exceptions and performance
issues.

### Quick Usage Example

To generate some events that will show up in Sentry, you can log messages
or capture errors:

```python
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

sentry_sdk.capture_message("Hello Sentry!")  # You'll see this in your
Sentry dashboard.

raise ValueError("Oops, something went wrong!")  # This will create an
error event in Sentry.
```

## 📚 Documentation

For more details on advanced usage, integrations, and customization, check
out the full documentation on [https://docs.sentry.io].

## 🧩 Integrations

Sentry integrates with a ton of popular Python libraries and frameworks,
including [FastAPI], [Django], [Celery], [OpenAI] and many, many more. 
Check out the [full list of integrations] to get the full picture.

## 🚧 Migrating Between Versions?

### From `1.x` to `2.x`

If you're using the older `1.x` version of the SDK, now's the time to
upgrade to `2.x`. It includes significant upgrades and new features. Check
our [migration guide] for assistance.

### From `raven-python`

Using the legacy `raven-python` client? It's now in maintenance mode, and
we recommend migrating to the new SDK for an improved experience. Get all
the details in our [migration guide].
