# Official Sentry SDK for Python

[Build Status]
[![PyPi page link -- version]](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sentry-sdk)
[Discord]

This is the official Python SDK for [Sentry]

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

### Configuration

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "https://12927b5f211046b575ee51fd8b1ac34f@o1.ingest.sentry.io/1",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

### Usage

```python
from sentry_sdk import capture_message
capture_message("Hello World")  # Will create an event in Sentry.

raise ValueError()  # Will also create an event in Sentry.
```

## Migrating

### Migrating From `1.x` to `2.x`

If you're on SDK version 1.x, we highly recommend updating to the 2.x
major. To make the process easier we've prepared a [migration guide] with
the most common changes as well as a [detailed changelog].

### Migrating From `raven-python`

The old `raven-python` client has entered maintenance mode and was moved
[here].

If you're using `raven-python`, we recommend you to migrate to this new
SDK. You can find the benefits of migrating and how to do it in our
[migration guide].
