sentry_sdk.init(
    "https://12927b5f211046b575ee51fd8b1ac34f@o1.ingest.sentry.io/1",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

## Migrate From sentry-raven

The old `raven-python` client has entered maintenance mode and was moved
[here].

If you're using `raven-python`, we recommend you to migrate to this new
SDK. You can find the benefits of migrating and how to do it in our
[migration guide].
