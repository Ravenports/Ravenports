# Official Sentry SDK for Python

[Build Status]
[![PyPi page link -- version]](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sentry-sdk)
[Discord]

Welcome to the official Python SDK for **[Sentry]**!

## Getting Started

### Installation

Getting Sentry into your project is straightforward. Just run this command
in your terminal:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

### Basic Configuration

Here’s a quick configuration example to get Sentry up and running:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "https://12927b5f211046b575ee51fd8b1ac34f@o1.ingest.sentry.io/1",  #
Your DSN here

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

With this configuration, Sentry will monitor for exceptions and performance
issues.

### Quick Usage Example

To generate some events that will show up in Sentry, you can log messages
or capture errors:

```python
from sentry_sdk import capture_message
capture_message("Hello Sentry!")  # You'll see this in your Sentry
dashboard.

raise ValueError("Oops, something went wrong!")  # This will create an
error event in Sentry.
```

### Rolling Your Own Integration?

If you want to create a new integration or improve an existing one, we’d
welcome your contributions! Please read our [contributing guide] before
starting.

## Migrating Between Versions?

### From `1.x` to `2.x`

If you're using the older `1.x` version of the SDK, now's the time to
upgrade to `2.x`. It includes significant upgrades and new features. Check
our [migration guide] for assistance.

### From `raven-python`

Using the legacy `raven-python` client? It's now in maintenance mode, and
we recommend migrating to the new SDK for an improved experience. Get all
