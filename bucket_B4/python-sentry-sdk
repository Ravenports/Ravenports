This is the official Python SDK for [Sentry]

---

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

### Configuration

```python

sentry_sdk.init(
    "https://12927b5f211046b575ee51fd8b1ac34f@o1.ingest.sentry.io/1",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

### Usage

```python
from sentry_sdk import capture_message
capture_message("Hello World")  # Will create an event in Sentry.

raise ValueError()  # Will also create an event in Sentry.
