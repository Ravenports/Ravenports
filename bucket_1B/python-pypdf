# pypdf

pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library capable of
splitting,
[merging],
[cropping, and transforming]
the pages of PDF files. It can also add
custom data, viewing options, and
[passwords]
to PDF files. pypdf can
[retrieve text]
and
[metadata]
from PDFs as well.

See [pdfly] for a CLI application that uses pypdf to interact with PDFs.

## Installation

Install pypdf using pip:

`
pip install pypdf
`

For using pypdf with AES encryption or decryption, install extra
dependencies:

```
pip install pypdf[crypto]
```

> **NOTE**: `pypdf` 3.1.0 and above include significant improvements
compared to
> previous versions. Please refer to [the migration
> guide] for
> more information.

## Usage

```python
from pypdf import PdfReader

reader = PdfReader("example.pdf")
number_of_pages = len(reader.pages)
page = reader.pages[0]
text = page.extract_text()
```

pypdf can do a lot more, e.g. splitting, merging, reading and creating
annotations, decrypting and encrypting. Check out the
[documentation] for additional usage
examples!

## Contributions

Maintaining pypdf is a collaborative effort. You can support the project by
writing documentation, helping to narrow down issues, and submitting code.
See the [CONTRIBUTING.md] file for more information.

### Q&A

The experience pypdf users have covers the whole range from beginner to
expert. You can contribute to the pypdf community by answering questions
on [StackOverflow],
helping in [discussions],
and asking users who report issues for [MCVE]'s (Code + example PDF!).

### Issues

A good bug ticket includes a MCVE - a minimal complete verifiable example.
For pypdf, this means that you must upload a PDF that causes the bug to
occur
as well as the code you're executing with all of the output. Use
`print(pypdf.__version__)` to tell us which version you're using.

### Code

All code contributions are welcome, but smaller ones have a better chance
to
get included in a timely manner. Adding unit tests for new features or test
cases for bugs you've fixed help us to ensure that the Pull Request (PR) is
fine.

pypdf includes a test suite which can be executed with `pytest`:

```bash
$ pytest
===================== test session starts =====================
