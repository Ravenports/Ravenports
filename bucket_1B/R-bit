bit: A Class for Vectors of 1-Bit Booleans

True boolean datatype (no NAs), coercion from and to logicals, integers and
integer subscripts; fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics.
With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the
expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less
RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R
calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains
for vectors of size &gt; 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean
operations it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when
such components are used more than once. Reading from and writing to bit is
approximately as fast as accessing standard logicals - mostly due to R's
time for memory allocation. The package allows to work with pre-allocated
memory for return values by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the
speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to
logical requires only 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical;
and copying from logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the
package now contains further classes for representing logical selections:
'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of
values for chunked processing. All three index classes can be used for
subsetting 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).
