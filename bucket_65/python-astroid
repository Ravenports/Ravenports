What's this?
------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code. It is currently the library powering pylint's
capabilities.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`
module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
usages. They include some support for static inference and local name
scopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build partial trees by inspecting
living
objects.

Installation
------------

Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::

    pip install .

If you want to do an editable installation, you can run::

    pip install -e .

If you have any questions, please mail the code-quality@python.org
mailing list for support. See
http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality for subscription
information and archives.
