==============
 CSS Minifier
==============

RCSSmin is a CSS minifier.

The minifier is based on the semantics of the `YUI compressor`_\, which
itself
is based on `the rule list by Isaac Schlueter`_\.

This module is a re-implementation aiming for speed instead of maximum
compression, so it can be used at runtime (rather than during a
preprocessing
step). RCSSmin does syntactical compression only (removing spaces, comments
and possibly semicolons). It does not provide semantic compression (like
removing empty blocks, collapsing redundant properties etc). It does,
however,
support various CSS hacks (by keeping them working as intended).

Here's a feature list:

- Strings are kept, except that escaped newlines are stripped
- Space/Comments before the very end or before various characters are
  stripped: ``:{});=>],!`` (The colon (``:``) is a special case, a single
  space is kept if it's outside a ruleset.)
- Space/Comments at the very beginning or after various characters are
  stripped: ``{}(=:>[,!``
- Optional space after unicode escapes is kept, resp. replaced by a simple
  space
- whitespaces inside ``url()`` definitions are stripped, except if it's a
  quoted non-base64 data url
- The nesting selector (``&``) is recognized
- Comments starting with an exclamation mark (``!``) can be kept
optionally.
- All other comments and/or whitespace characters are replaced by a single
  space.
- Multiple consecutive semicolons are reduced to one
- The last semicolon within a ruleset is stripped
- CSS Hacks supported:

  - IE7 hack (``>/**/``)
  - Mac-IE5 hack (``/*\*/.../**/``)
  - The boxmodelhack is supported naturally because it relies on valid CSS2
    strings
  - Between ``:first-line`` and the following comma or curly brace a space
is
    inserted. (apparently it's needed for IE6)
  - Same for ``:first-letter``

rcssmin.c is a reimplementation of rcssmin.py in C and improves runtime up
to
factor 100 or so (depending on the input). docs/BENCHMARKS in the source
distribution contains the details.

Supported python versions are 2.7 and 3.6+.
