packaging
=========

.. start-intro

Reusable core utilities for various Python Packaging
[interoperability specifications].

This library provides utilities that implement the interoperability
specifications which have clearly one correct behaviour (eg: :pep:`440`)
or benefit greatly from having a single shared implementation (eg:
:pep:`425`).

.. end-intro

The packaging project includes the following: version handling, specifiers,
markers, requirements, tags, utilities.

Documentation
-------------

The `documentation`_ provides information and the API for the following:

- Version Handling
- Specifiers
