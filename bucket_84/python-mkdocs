MkDocs is a **fast**, **simple** and **downright gorgeous** static site
generator that's geared towards building project documentation.
Documentation
source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML
configuration file. It is designed to be easy to use and can be extended
with
third-party themes, plugins, and Markdown extensions.

Please see the [Documentation][mkdocs] for an introductory tutorial and a
full
user guide.

## Features

- Build static HTML files from Markdown files.
- Use Plugins and Markdown Extensions to enhance MkDocs.
- Use the built-in themes, third party themes or create your own.
- Publish your documentation anywhere that static files can be served.
- Much more!
