What is this?
-------------

Twisted is a Python event-based framework for internet applications.
It includes modules for many different purposes, including the following:

- ``twisted.web``: HTTP clients and servers, HTML templating, and a WSGI
server
- ``twisted.conch``: SSHv2 and Telnet clients and servers and terminal
emulators
- ``twisted.words``: Clients and servers for IRC, XMPP, and other IM
protocols
- ``twisted.mail``: IMAPv4, POP3, SMTP clients and servers
- ``twisted.positioning``: Tools for communicating with NMEA-compatible GPS
receivers
- ``twisted.names``: DNS client and tools for making your own DNS servers
- ``twisted.trial``: A unit testing framework that integrates well with
Twisted-based code.

Twisted supports all major system event loops -- select (all platforms),
poll (most POSIX platforms), epoll (Linux), kqueue (FreeBSD, macOS), IOCP
(Windows), and various GUI event loops (GTK+2/3, Qt, wxWidgets).
Third-party reactors can plug into Twisted, and provide support for
additional event loops.

Installing
----------

To install the latest version of Twisted using pip::

  $ pip install twisted

Additional instructions for installing this software are in [the
installation instructions].

Documentation and Support
-------------------------

Twisted's documentation is available from the [Twisted Matrix Read The Docs
website].
This documentation contains how-tos, code examples, and an API reference.

Help is also available on the [Twisted mailing list].

There is also an IRC channel, ``#twisted``,
on the `Libera.Chat <https://libera.chat/>`_ network.
A web client is available at `web.libera.chat <https://web.libera.chat/>`_.

Unit Tests
----------

Twisted has a comprehensive test suite, which can be run by tox::

  $ tox -l                       # to view all test environments
  $ tox -e nocov                 # to run all the tests without coverage
  $ tox -e withcov               # to run all the tests with coverage
  $ tox -e alldeps-withcov-posix # install all dependencies, run tests with
coverage on POSIX platform

You can test running the test suite under the different reactors with the
TWISTED_REACTOR environment variable::

  $ env TWISTED_REACTOR=epoll tox -e alldeps-withcov-posix

Some of these tests may fail if you:

* don't have the dependencies required for a particular subsystem
installed,
* have a firewall blocking some ports (or things like Multicast, which
Linux NAT has shown itself to do), or
* run them as root.

Static Code Checkers
--------------------

You can ensure that code complies to Twisted [coding standards]::
