[FILE:3340:descriptions/desc.single]
lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.
It provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the
ElementTree API.

It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

To contact the project, go to the [project home page]
or see our bug tracker at https://launchpad.net/lxml

In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
you can get it from the github repository at
https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home page.

After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
available at
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-6.0 .
Running ``pip install
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/archive/refs/heads/lxml-6.0.tar.gz``
will install the unreleased branch state as soon as a maintenance branch
has been established.
Note that this requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version
for the build.

6.0.0 (2025-06-26)
==================

Features added
--------------

* GH#463: ``lxml.html.diff`` is faster and provides structurally better
diffs.
  Original patch by Steven Fernandez.

* GH#405: The factories Element and ElementTree can now be used in type
hints.

* GH#448: Parsing from memoryview and other buffers is supported to allow
zero-copy parsing.

* GH#437: ``lxml.html.builder`` was missing several HTML5 tag names.
  Patch by Nick Tarleton.

* GH#458: CDATA can now be written into the incremental ``xmlfile()``
writer.
  Original patch by Lane Shaw.

* A new parser option ``decompress=False`` was added that controls the
automatic
  input decompression when using libxml2 2.15.0 or later.  Disabling this
option
  by default will effectively prevent decompression bombs when handling
untrusted
  input.  Code that depends on automatic decompression must enable this
option.
  Note that libxml2 2.15.0 was not released yet, so this option currently
has no
  effect but can already be used.

* The set of compile time / runtime supported libxml2 feature names is
available as
  ``etree.LIBXML_COMPILED_FEATURES and etree.LIBXML_FEATURES``.
  This currently includes
  catalog, ftp, html, http, iconv, icu,
  lzma, regexp, schematron, xmlschema, xpath, zlib.

Bugs fixed
----------

* GH#353: Predicates in ``.find*()`` could mishandle tag indices if a
default namespace is provided.
  Original patch by Luise K.

* GH#272: The head and body properties of ``lxml.html`` elements failed if
no such element
  was found.  They now return None instead.
  Original patch by FVolral.

* Tag names provided by code (API, not data) that are longer than INT_MAX
  could be truncated or mishandled in other ways.

* ``.text_content() on lxml.html`` elements accidentally returned a "smart
string"
  without additional information.  It now returns a plain string.

* LP#2109931: When building lxml with coverage reporting, it now disables
the ``sys.monitoring``
  support due to the lack of support in
https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1790

Other changes
-------------

* Support for Python < 3.8 was removed.

* Parsing directly from zlib (or lzma) compressed data is now considered an
optional
  feature in lxml.  It may get removed from libxml2 at some point for
security reasons
