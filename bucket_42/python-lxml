[FILE:2262:descriptions/desc.single]
lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries. 
It
provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the
ElementTree
API.

It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

To contact the project, go to the [project home page
] or see our bug tracker at
https://launchpad.net/lxml

In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
you can get it from the github repository at
https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
page.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will
install lxml from
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
an appropriate version of Cython installed.

After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
available at
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-4.7 .
Running ``easy_install lxml==4.7bugfix`` will install
the unreleased branch state from
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-4.7#egg=lxml-4.7bugfix
as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this
requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.

4.7.1 (2021-12-13)
==================

Features added
--------------

* Chunked Unicode string parsing via ``parser.feed()`` now encodes the
input data
  to the native UTF-8 encoding directly, instead of going through
Py_UNICODE /
  wchar_t encoding first, which previously required duplicate recoding in
most cases.

Bugs fixed
----------

* The standard namespace prefixes were mishandled during "C14N2"
serialisation on Python 3.
  See
https://mail.python.org/archives/list/lxml@python.org/thread/6ZFBHFOVHOS5GFDOAMPCT6HM5HZPWQ4Q/

* ``lxml.objectify`` previously accepted non-XML numbers with underscores
(like "1_000")
  as integers or float values in Python 3.6 and later. It now adheres to
the number
  format of the XML spec again.

* LP#1939031: Static wheels of lxml now contain the header files of zlib
and libiconv
  (in addition to the already provided headers of
libxml2/libxslt/libexslt).

Other changes
-------------

* Wheels include libxml2 2.9.12+ and libxslt 1.1.34 (also on Windows).
