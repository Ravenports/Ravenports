[FILE:1140:descriptions/desc.single]
lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.
It provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the
ElementTree API.

It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
you can get it from the github repository at https://github.com/lxml/lxml.
Note that this requires Cython to build the sources, see the build
instructions on the project home page.  To the same end, running "easy_install
lxml==dev" will install lxml from
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
an appropriate version of Cython installed.

After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
available at https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-4.2.  Running
"easy_install lxml==4.2bugfix" will install the unreleased branch state
from https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-4.2#egg=lxml-4.2bugfix
as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this
requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.
