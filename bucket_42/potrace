[FILE:831:descriptions/desc.primary]
Potrace(TM) is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a 
bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, 
PPM, or BMP format), and the output is one of several vector file formats. 
A typical use is to create SVG or PDF files from scanned data, such as 
company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image 
is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any 
resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: SVG, PDF, EPS, 
PostScript, DXF, GeoJSON, PGM (for easy antialiasing of pixel-based 
images), Gimppath, and XFig. Additional backends might be added in the 
future.

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to 
pre-process the input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and color 
images.
