What's a Task Queue?
====================

Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or
machines.

A task queue's input is a unit of work, called a task, dedicated worker
processes then constantly monitor the queue for new work to perform.

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a broker
to mediate between clients and workers. To initiate a task a client puts a
message on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a worker.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way
to high availability and horizontal scaling.

Celery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any
language. In addition to Python there's node-celery_ for Node.js,
a `PHP client`_ and `gocelery`_ for golang.

Language interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks
in such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker.

What do I need?
===============

Celery version 4.4.0 runs on,

- Python (2.7, 3.8, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7)
- PyPy2.7 (7.2)
- PyPy3.5 (7.1)
- PyPy3.6 (7.6)


4.x.x is the last version to support Python 2.7,
and from the next major version (Celery 5.x) Python 3.6 or newer is
required.

If you're running an older version of Python, you need to be running
an older version of Celery:

- Python 2.6: Celery series 3.1 or earlier.
- Python 2.5: Celery series 3.0 or earlier.
- Python 2.4 was Celery series 2.2 or earlier.

Celery is a project with minimal funding,
so we don't support Microsoft Windows.
Please don't open any issues related to that platform.

*Celery* is usually used with a message broker to send and receive
messages.
The RabbitMQ, Redis transports are feature complete,
but there's also experimental support for a myriad of other solutions,
including
using SQLite for local development.

*Celery* can run on a single machine, on multiple machines, or even
across datacenters.

Get Started
===========

new to Celery 4.4 coming from previous versions then you should read our
getting started tutorials:
