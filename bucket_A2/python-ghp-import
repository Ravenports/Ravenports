GitHub Pages Import
===================

[CI status]

[License]
[Version]

As part of [gunicorn][gunicorn], [Benoit Chesneau][benoit] and [Paul
Davis][davisp]
were looking at how to host documentation. There's the obvious method of
using [GitHub's post-receive hook][github-post] to trigger doc builds and
rsync
to a webserver, but we ended up wanting to try out github's hosting to make
the
whole interface a bit more robust.

[GitHub Pages][gh-pages] is a pretty awesome service that GitHub provides
for
hosting project documentation. The only thing is that it requires a
`gh-pages` branch that is the site's document root. This means that keeping
documentation sources in the branch with code is a bit difficult. And it
really
turns into a head scratcher for things like [Sphinx][sphinx] that want to
access documentation sources and code sources at the same time.

Then we stumbled across an interesting looking package called
[github-tools][github-tools] that looked almost like what we wanted. It was
a tad
complicated and more involved than we wanted but it gave us an idea. Why
not
just write a script that can copy a directory to the `gh-pages` branch of
the
repository. This saves us from even having to think about the branch and
everything becomes magical.

This is what `ghp-import` was written for.

Big Fat Warning
---------------

This will **DESTROY** your `gh-pages` branch. If you love it, you'll want
to
take backups before playing with this. This script assumes that `gh-pages`
is
100% derivative. You should never edit files in your `gh-pages` branch by
hand
if you're using this script because you will lose your work.

When used with a prefix, only files below the set prefix will be destroyed,
limiting the
above warning to just that directory and everything below it.

Usage
-----

```
Usage: ghp-import [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY

Options:
  -n, --no-jekyll       Include a .nojekyll file in the branch.
  -c CNAME, --cname=CNAME
                        Write a CNAME file with the given CNAME.
  -m MESG, --message=MESG
                        The commit message to use on the target branch.
  -p, --push            Push the branch to origin/{branch} after
committing.
  -x PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
                        The prefix to add to each file that gets pushed to
the
                        remote. Only files below this prefix will be
cleared
                        out. [none]
  -f, --force           Force the push to the repository.
  -o, --no-history      Force new commit without parent history.
  -r REMOTE, --remote=REMOTE
                        The name of the remote to push to. [origin]
  -b BRANCH, --branch=BRANCH
                        Name of the branch to write to. [gh-pages]
  -s, --shell           Use the shell when invoking Git. [False]
  -l, --follow-links    Follow symlinks when adding files. [False]
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

Its pretty simple. Inside your repository just run `ghp-import $DOCS_DIR`
where `$DOCS_DIR` is the path to the **built** documentation. This will
write a
commit to your `gh-pages` branch with the current documents in it.
