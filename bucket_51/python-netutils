## Overview

A Python library that is a collection of functions that are used in the
common network automation tasks. Tasks such as converting a BGP ASN to and
from dotted format, normalizing an interface name, or "type 5" encrypting a
password. The intention is to centralize these functions while keeping the
library light.

## Documentation

Full web-based HTML documentation for this library can be found over on the
[Netutils Docs] website:

- [User Guide] - Overview, Using the library, Getting Started.
- [Administrator Guide] - How to Install, Configure, Upgrade, or Uninstall
the library.
- [Developer Guide] - Extending the library, Code Reference, Contribution
Guide.
- [Release Notes / Changelog].
- [Frequently Asked Questions].

### Contributing to the Docs

All the Markdown source for the library documentation can be found under
the [docs] folder in this repository. For simple edits, a Markdown capable
editor is sufficient - clone the repository and edit away.

If you need to view the fully generated documentation site, you can build
it with [mkdocs]. A container hosting the docs will be started using the
invoke commands (details in the [Development Environment Guide]) on
[http://localhost:8001]. As your changes are saved, the live docs will be
automatically reloaded.

Any PRs with fixes or improvements are very welcome!
