[FILE:529:descriptions/desc.single]
Devilution is a project to re-create and document the source code for the 
game Diablo 1 as closely to the original as possible. It was 
reverse-engineered and cleaned up (believed to be legal under the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act's documentation and interoperability exceptions).

DevilutionX is a portable version of the engine that uses SDL to run 
across modern operating systems. This package contains just the engine, no 
game data is provided. You will need the original resource container 
("diabdat.mpq") to play.

[FILE:558:files/pkg-message-single.in]
To play the game you need the resource container file DIABDAT.MPQ. Copy
it off your Diablo CD or extract it (using e.g. innoextract) from the
GOG version (see https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Then put it into the
directory ~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution and make sure it is
spelled all lower-case!

NOTE: 64-bit builds of devilutionX are considered experimental right now.
The game is playable but there are major flaws such as morphing potions,
missing features like character deletion, etc. These issues are known
and are being addressed upstream.
