## [Gitoxide]: A peek into the future…

I started working on GitPython in 2009, back in the days when Python was
'my thing' and I had great plans with it.
Of course, back in the days, I didn't really know what I was doing and this
shows in many places. Somewhat similar to
Python this happens to be 'good enough', but at the same time is deeply
flawed and broken beyond repair.

By now, GitPython is widely used and I am sure there is a good reason for
that, it's something to be proud of and happy about.
The community is maintaining the software and is keeping it relevant for
which I am absolutely grateful. For the time to come I am happy to continue
maintaining GitPython, remaining hopeful that one day it won't be needed
anymore.

More than 15 years after my first meeting with 'git' I am still in excited
about it, and am happy to finally have the tools and
probably the skills to scratch that itch of mine: implement `git` in a way
that makes tool creation a piece of cake for most.

If you like the idea and want to learn more, please head over to
[gitoxide], an
implementation of 'git' in [Rust].

*(Please note that `gitoxide` is not currently available for use in Python,
and that Rust is required.)*

## GitPython

GitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories,
high-level like git-porcelain,
or low-level like git-plumbing.

It provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data
often backed by calling the `git`
command-line program.

### DEVELOPMENT STATUS

This project is in **maintenance mode**, which means that

- …there will be no feature development, unless these are contributed
- …there will be no bug fixes, unless they are relevant to the safety of
users, or contributed
- …issues will be responded to with waiting times of up to a month

The project is open to contributions of all kinds, as well as new
maintainers.

### REQUIREMENTS

GitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and
available in your
`PATH` for most operations. If it is not in your `PATH`, you can help
GitPython find it
by setting the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment
variable.

- Git (1.7.x or newer)
- Python >= 3.7

The list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt` and
`./test-requirements.txt`.
The installer takes care of installing them for you.

### INSTALL

GitPython and its required package dependencies can be installed in any of
the following ways, all of which should typically be done in a [virtual
environment].

#### From PyPI

To obtain and install a copy [from PyPI], run:

`sh
pip install GitPython
`

(A distribution package can also be downloaded for manual installation at
[the PyPI page].)

#### From downloaded source code

If you have downloaded the source code, run this from inside the unpacked
`GitPython` directory:

```sh
pip install .
```

#### By cloning the source code repository

To clone the [the GitHub repository] from source to work on the code, you
can do it like so:
