Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python
programming language.  Its main features are the complete implementation of
the Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety (several threads
can
share the same connection).  It was designed for heavily multi-threaded
applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a large
number
of concurrent "INSERT"s or "UPDATE"s.

Psycopg 2 is mostly implemented in C as a libpq wrapper, resulting in being
both efficient and secure.  It features client-side and server-side
cursors,
asynchronous communication and notifications, "COPY TO/COPY FROM" support.
Many Python types are supported out-of-the-box and adapted to matching
PostgreSQL data types; adaptation can be extended and customized thanks to
a
flexible objects adaptation system.

Psycopg 2 is both Unicode and Python 3 friendly.
